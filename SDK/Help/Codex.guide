Welcome to Codex, a comprehensive code analysis tool designed specifically for Amiga C development. Codex combines the power of a traditional linter with specialized validation for Amiga coding standards, compiler compatibility, and memory safety.

It analyzes your C source code without compilation, providing immediate feedback on potential issues, style violations, and compatibility problems. It's designed to catch common programming errors early, saving you time and improving code quality.

@{B}Overview and Purpose@{UB}

@{"Back to Main" LINK "main"}

Codex is a static analysis tool that examines C source code for various types of issues:

* @{B}Syntax and Standards Compliance@{UB} - Ensures your code follows C89 or C99 standards.
* @{B}Compiler Compatibility@{UB} - Identifies code that won't compile with specific Amiga compilers (SAS/C, VBCC, DICE).
* @{B}Amiga Coding Standards@{UB} - Enforces Amiga-specific best practices and conventions.
* @{B}Memory Safety@{UB} - Detects potentially unsafe functions and suggests alternatives.
* @{B}Code Style@{UB} - Checks for common style violations like magic numbers.

Unlike a compiler, Codex doesn't generate object code. Instead, it performs lexical analysis and pattern matching to identify potential problems. This makes it extremely fast and useful for:

* @{B}Pre-commit validation@{UB} - Check code before committing to version control.
* @{B}Continuous integration@{UB} - Automated code quality checks in build pipelines.
* @{B}Learning and education@{UB} - Understand common C programming pitfalls.
* @{B}Legacy code analysis@{UB} - Evaluate existing codebases for issues.

@{B}Validation Modes@{UB}

@{"Back to Main" LINK "main"}

Codex operates in different validation modes, each focusing on specific aspects of code quality. For a detailed list of every test performed in each mode, see the @{"All Tests Explained" LINK "all_tests"} node.

@{B}C89 Standards Mode (@{"C89/S" LINK "usage"})@{UB}
Enforces strict ANSI C89 compliance, flagging C99 features like @{I}// comments@{UI}, @{I}inline@{UI} keyword, and variable declarations after statements. This is the default mode.

@{B}C99 Standards Mode (@{"C99/S" LINK "usage"})@{UB}
Validates against the C99 standard. Instead of errors, it provides warnings for C99-specific features to ensure the developer is aware they are using them.

@{B}Amiga Standards Mode (@{"AMIGA/S" LINK "usage"})@{UB}
Enforces Amiga-specific conventions, such as using Amiga types (@{I}LONG@{UI}, @{I}STRPTR@{UI}), enforcing @{I}PascalCase@{UI} for function names, and using the @{I}NULL@{UI} constant.

@{B}Compiler Modes (@{"SASC/S" LINK "usage"}, @{"VBCC/S" LINK "usage"}, @{"DICE/S" LINK "usage"})@{UB}
These modes check for keyword compatibility with a specific target compiler and suggest universal replacements from @{I}<clib/compiler-specific.h>@{UI}.

@{B}Memory Safety Mode (@{"MEMSAFE/S" LINK "usage"})@{UB}
Identifies potentially memory-unsafe functions from the standard C library, such as @{I}strcpy@{UI} and @{I}gets@{UI}, and provides qualified guidance.

@{B}All Tests Explained@{UB}

@{"Back to Main" LINK "main"}

This section details every specific check performed by Codex and which mode activates it.

@{B}General Style Checks (Always Active)@{UB}
* @{B}Line Length:@{UB} Flags lines longer than 256 characters.
* @{B}Magic Numbers:@{UB} Flags hardcoded numerical constants (e.g., @{I}if (x > 100)@{UI}) and suggests using named constants.

@{B}C89 Standards Mode (@{"C89/S" LINK "usage"})@{UB}
* @{B}Declaration Placement:@{UB} Flags variable declarations that appear after a statement within a block.
* @{B}C99 Keywords:@{UB} Flags C99-specific keywords like @{I}inline@{UI}, @{I}restrict@{UI}, and @{I}_Bool@{UI}.
* @{B}C++ Comments:@{UB} Flags single-line @{I}//@{UI} comments (unless in @{"SASC/S" LINK "usage"} mode).
* @{B}For-Loop Declarations:@{UB} Flags variable declarations inside a @{I}for@{UI} loop initializer (e.g., @{I}for (int i = 0;...)@{UI}).
* @{B}C99 Features:@{UB} Flags designated initializers, compound literals, variadic macros, and flexible array members.
* @{B}C99 Functions/Headers:@{UB} Flags standard library functions and headers introduced in C99.

@{B}Amiga Standards Mode (@{"AMIGA/S" LINK "usage"})@{UB}
* @{B}Amiga Types:@{UB} Recommends using Amiga-specific types (@{I}LONG@{UI}, @{I}STRPTR@{UI}, @{I}APTR@{UI}, etc.) instead of standard C types (@{I}long@{UI}, @{I}char *@{UI}, @{I}void *@{UI}).
* @{B}PascalCase:@{UB} Checks that user-defined function names use @{I}PascalCase@{UI}.
* @{B}NULL for Pointers:@{UB} Checks for assignments of @{I}0@{UI} to pointers and recommends using the @{I}NULL@{UI} constant.

@{B}Troubleshooting@{UB}

@{"Back to Main" LINK "main"}

@{B}No Files Found@{UB}
Check your file paths and ensure your wildcard patterns are correct for the Amiga shell.

@{B}False Positives@{UB}
Codex uses fast lexical analysis, not full semantic parsing. It may occasionally misinterpret complex code. For example, it might flag a keyword that appears inside a string literal. These can typically be ignored.

@{B}Known Limitations@{UB}
* No semantic analysis: Codex does not understand program logic.
* No preprocessor handling: It does not process macros or follow #includes.
* No cross-file analysis: Each file is processed independently.

These limitations are by design to ensure Codex remains fast and lightweight. For deeper analysis, a C compiler is required.

@TITLE "Codex - Self-Improvement"

@{B}Self-Improvement: Codex Linting Itself@{UB}

@{"Back to Main" LINK "main"}

Codex was designed to improve code quality, and it proved its effectiveness by improving its own source code. When Codex was run on its own source files, it identified several legitimate C89 compliance issues that were then systematically fixed.

@{B}Legitimate Issues Found and Fixed@{UB}

* @{B}Variable Declaration Placement@{UB} - Fixed a static variable declaration that appeared after other statements in the main() function, violating C89 rules requiring all declarations at the beginning of a block.

* @{B}Magic Numbers@{UB} - Replaced numerous hardcoded numerical constants with named constants:
  * @{I}COMMENT_START_LENGTH = 2@{UI} for comment parsing offsets
  * @{I}ESCAPE_SEQUENCE_LENGTH = 2@{UI} for escape sequence handling
  * @{I}PREVIOUS_CHAR_OFFSET = 1@{UI} for character position calculations
  * @{I}ARRAY_OFFSET_1 = 1@{UI} for array indexing operations
  * @{I}TRUNCATION_START = 117@{UI} and @{I}TRUNCATION_LENGTH = 3@{UI} for line excerpt handling
  * @{I}VERSION_START_OFFSET = 1@{UI} for version string parsing
  * @{I}LINE_EXCERPT_LIMIT = 120@{UI} for excerpt length limits
  * @{I}REPLACEMENT_BUFFER_SIZE = 64@{UI} for replacement text buffers
  * @{I}LARGE_MESSAGE_BUFFER_SIZE = 512@{UI} for detailed error messages

* @{B}Error Message Consistency@{UB} - Updated hardcoded error messages to use dynamic values where appropriate, improving maintainability.

@{B}False Alarms Identified@{UB}

Codex also demonstrated its detection accuracy by correctly identifying several "false alarms" - these were actually examples of features embedded in the rule data arrays, not actual violations in the code:

* C99 keywords and features in string literals (these are metadata for the linter)
* Variable declarations in for loops (examples in rule data)
* C++ comments in string literals (error message text to detect)

@{B}Benefits of Self-Linting@{UB}

This self-improvement process demonstrated several key benefits:

* @{B}Validation of Detection Logic@{UB} - Proved that Codex correctly identifies actual violations while preserving rule data
* @{B}Improved Code Quality@{UB} - The source code is now fully C89/SASC compliant
* @{B}Better Maintainability@{UB} - Named constants make the code easier to understand and modify
* @{B}Real-World Testing@{UB} - Confirmed that Codex works effectively on complex, real codebases

@{B}Lessons Learned@{UB}

The self-linting exercise revealed that Codex's detection algorithms are robust and accurate. The "false alarms" were actually proof that the tool correctly distinguishes between actual code violations and embedded rule examples. This gives users confidence that when Codex flags an issue, it's a genuine problem that should be addressed.

This self-improvement process serves as a testament to Codex's effectiveness and demonstrates the value of using static analysis tools during development.
