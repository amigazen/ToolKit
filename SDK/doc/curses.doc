   NAME
	initscr -- initialize curses screen

   SYNOPSIS
	result = initscr ();

	int initscr (void);

   FUNCTION
	This must be called before any window can be created or
	manipulated. It creates "stdscr" and "curscr". curscr is a copy of
	what curses thinks is currently on the display. Calling
	wrefresh(curscr) will redraw the entire screen and is useful for
	noisy modem lines. This is usually called when the user types ^L
	or sometimes ^R in older programs.

   INPUTS
	None.

   RESULT
	On Success, OK is returned.
	On error, ERR is returned

   EXAMPLE

   NOTES
	This function must be called before any other curses functions.

   NAME
	endwin -- cleanup and exit curses

   SYNOPSIS
	result = endwin ();

	int endwin (void);

   FUNCTION
	This should be called before exiting a curses program.
	It frees all memory used and dismantles all structures.
	It closes the custom screen and window used if curses is used in
	non-ANSI mode.

   INPUTS
	None.

   RESULT
	On Success, OK is returned.
	On error, ERR is returned

   EXAMPLE

   NOTES
	This function should be called before program exit to clean up
	curses resources.

curses/beep                                                           curses/beep

   NAME
	beep -- produce audible beep

   SYNOPSIS
	result = beep ();

	int beep (void);

   FUNCTION
	Produces an audible beep from the speaker. This beep is similar in pitch
	and duration to the beep from a terminal when a BEL (^G) character is
	received. If curses is running in ANSI mode, a BEL character will
	be sent to the terminal.

   INPUTS
	None.

   RESULT
	On Success, OK is returned.
	On error, ERR is returned

   NAME
	flash -- flash the display

   SYNOPSIS
	result = flash ();

	int flash (void);

   FUNCTION
	Flashes the display by complementing the background colour. With the
	default black background, this will flash the screen yellow. If
	curses is being used in ANSI mode, a BEL character will be sent to
	the terminal.

   INPUTS
	None.

   RESULT
	On Success, OK is returned.
	On error, ERR is returned

curses/baudrate                                                     curses/baudrate

   NAME
	baudrate -- get current baud rate

   SYNOPSIS
	rate = baudrate ();

	int baudrate (void);

   FUNCTION
	Returns current baudrate. On the Amiga, it just returns 19200. It is
	used to decide how much to refresh over slow serial lines such as
	modems.

   INPUTS
	None.

   RESULT
	19200 is returned.

   NAME
	box -- draw a box around a window

   SYNOPSIS
	result = box (win, vert, hor);

	int box (WINDOW *, char, char);

   FUNCTION
	Draws a box around the INSIDE edge of the window.
	win   - pointer returned from newwin or subwin, or stdscr even.
	vert  - character to use for the vertical.
	hor   - character to use for the horizontal.

	Either of the characters may be zero. In this case, the defaults of
	"|" and "-" will be used for vertical and horizontal respectively.

   INPUTS
	win		- window pointer
	vert		- vertical character (or 0 for default)
	hor		- horizontal character (or 0 for default)

   RESULT
	On Success, OK is returned.
	On error, ERR is returned

   EXAMPLE

   NOTES
	The box drawn is INSIDE the window. Therefore any of the clear routines
	will effect the box if carried out on its window. The normal thing
	to do is open two windows, one for the box two columns wider and
	two lines higher than the window for the text. Then use the inner
	window for the text. This way the box is only drawn once.
