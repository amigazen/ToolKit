   Here is a brief summary of how to invoke @{b}as@{ub}.  For details, see
@{"Comand-Line Options" link "Invoking"}.

@{b}-a[dhlns]@{ub}
     Turn on listings, in any of a variety of ways:

    @{b}-ad@{ub}
          omit debugging directives

    @{b}-ah@{ub}
          include high-level source

    @{b}-al@{ub}
          include assembly

    @{b}-an@{ub}
          omit forms processing

    @{b}-as@{ub}
          include symbols

    @{b}=file@{ub}
          set the name of the listing file

     You may combine these options; for example, use @{b}-aln@{ub} for assembly
     listing without forms processing.  The @{b}=file@{ub} option, if used, must
     be the last one.  By itself, @{b}-a@{ub} defaults to @{b}-ahls@{ub}--that is, all
     listings turned on.

@{b}-D@{ub}
     Ignored.  This option is accepted for script compatibility with
     calls to other assemblers.

@{b}--defsym SYM=VALUE@{ub}
     Define the symbol SYM to be VALUE before assembling the input file.
     VALUE must be an integer constant.  As in C, a leading @{b}0x@{ub}
     indicates a hexadecimal value, and a leading @{b}0@{ub} indicates an octal
     value.

@{b}-f@{ub}
     "fast"--skip whitespace and comment preprocessing (assume source is
     compiler output).

@{b}--help@{ub}
     Print a summary of the command line options and exit.

@{b}-I DIR@{ub}
     Add directory DIR to the search list for @{b}.include@{ub} directives.

@{b}-J@{ub}
     Don't warn about signed overflow.

@{b}-K@{ub}
     Issue warnings when difference tables altered for long
     displacements.

@{b}-L@{ub}
     Keep (in the symbol table) local symbols, starting with @{b}L@{ub}.

@{b}-o OBJFILE@{ub}
     Name the object-file output from @{b}as@{ub} OBJFILE.

@{b}-R@{ub}
     Fold the data section into the text section.

@{b}--statistics@{ub}
     Print the maximum space (in bytes) and total time (in seconds)
     used by assembly.

@{b}-v@{ub}
@{b}-version@{ub}
     Print the @{b}as@{ub} version.

@{b}--version@{ub}
     Print the @{b}as@{ub} version and exit.

@{b}-W@{ub}
     Suppress warning messages.

@{b}-w@{ub}
     Ignored.

@{b}-x@{ub}
     Ignored.

@{b}-Z@{ub}
     Generate an object file even after errors.

@{b}-- | FILES ...@{ub}
     Standard input, or source files to assemble.

   The following options are available when as is configured for a D10V
processor.
@{b}-O@{ub}
     Optimize output by parallelizing instructions.

   The following options are available when as is configured for the
Intel 80960 processor.

@{b}-ACA | -ACA_A | -ACB | -ACC | -AKA | -AKB | -AKC | -AMC@{ub}
     Specify which variant of the 960 architecture is the target.

@{b}-b@{ub}
     Add code to collect statistics about branches taken.

@{b}-no-relax@{ub}
     Do not alter compare-and-branch instructions for long
     displacements; error if necessary.

   The following options are available when as is configured for the
Motorola 68000 series.

@{b}-l@{ub}
     Shorten references to undefined symbols, to one word instead of
     two.

@{b}-m68000 | -m68008 | -m68010 | -m68020 | -m68030 | -m68040 | -m68060@{ub}
@{b}| -m68302 | -m68331 | -m68332 | -m68333 | -m68340 | -mcpu32 | -m5200@{ub}
     Specify what processor in the 68000 family is the target.  The
     default is normally the 68020, but this can be changed at
     configuration time.

@{b}-m68881 | -m68882 | -mno-68881 | -mno-68882@{ub}
     The target machine does (or does not) have a floating-point
     coprocessor.  The default is to assume a coprocessor for 68020,
     68030, and cpu32.  Although the basic 68000 is not compatible with
     the 68881, a combination of the two can be specified, since it's
     possible to do emulation of the coprocessor instructions with the
     main processor.

@{b}-m68851 | -mno-68851@{ub}
     The target machine does (or does not) have a memory-management
     unit coprocessor.  The default is to assume an MMU for 68020 and
     up.

   The following options are available when @{b}as@{ub} is configured for the
SPARC architecture:

@{b}-Av6 | -Av7 | -Av8 | -Asparclet | -Asparclite | -Av9 | -Av9a@{ub}
     Explicitly select a variant of the SPARC architecture.

@{b}-xarch=v8plus | -xarch=v8plusa@{ub}
     For compatibility with the Solaris v9 assembler.  These options are
     equivalent to -Av9 and -Av9a, respectively.

@{b}-bump@{ub}
     Warn when the assembler switches to another architecture.

   The following options are available when as is configured for a MIPS
processor.

@{b}-G NUM@{ub}
     This option sets the largest size of an object that can be
     referenced implicitly with the @{b}gp@{ub} register.  It is only accepted
     for targets that use ECOFF format, such as a DECstation running
     Ultrix.  The default value is 8.

@{b}-EB@{ub}
     Generate "big endian" format output.

@{b}-EL@{ub}
     Generate "little endian" format output.

@{b}-mips1@{ub}
@{b}-mips2@{ub}
@{b}-mips3@{ub}
     Generate code for a particular MIPS Instruction Set Architecture
     level.  @{b}-mips1@{ub} corresponds to the R2000 and R3000 processors,
     @{b}-mips2@{ub} to the R6000 processor, and @{b}-mips3@{ub} to the R4000 processor.

@{b}-m4650@{ub}

@{b}-no-m4650@{ub}
     Generate code for the MIPS R4650 chip.  This tells the assembler
     to accept the @{b}mad@{ub} and @{b}madu@{ub} instruction, and to not schedule @{b}nop@{ub}
     instructions around accesses to the @{b}HI@{ub} and @{b}LO@{ub} registers.
     @{b}-no-m4650@{ub} turns off this option.

@{b}-mcpu=CPU@{ub}
     Generate code for a particular MIPS cpu.  This has little effect
     on the assembler, but it is passed by @{b}gcc@{ub}.

@{b}--emulation=NAME@{ub}
     This option causes @{b}as@{ub} to emulated @{b}as@{ub} configured for some other
     target, in all respects, including output format (choosing between
     ELF and ECOFF only), handling of pseudo-opcodes which may generate
     debugging information or store symbol table information, and
     default endianness.  The available configuration names are:
     @{b}mipsecoff@{ub}, @{b}mipself@{ub}, @{b}mipslecoff@{ub}, @{b}mipsbecoff@{ub}, @{b}mipslelf@{ub}, @{b}mipsbelf@{ub}.
     The first two do not alter the default endianness from that of the
     primary target for which the assembler was configured; the others
     change the default to little- or big-endian as indicated by the @{b}b@{ub}
     or @{b}l@{ub} in the name.  Using @{b}-EB@{ub} or @{b}-EL@{ub} will override the endianness
     selection in any case.

     This option is currently supported only when the primary target @{b}as@{ub}
     is configured for is a MIPS ELF or ECOFF target.  Furthermore, the
     primary target or others specified with @{b}--enable-targets=...@{ub} at
     configuration time must include support for the other format, if
     both are to be available.  For example, the Irix 5 configuration
     includes support for both.

     Eventually, this option will support more configurations, with more
     fine-grained control over the assembler's behavior, and will be
     supported for more processors.

@{b}-nocpp@{ub}
@{b}     as@{ub} ignores this option.  It is accepted for compatibility with the
     native tools.

@{b}--trap@{ub}
@{b}--no-trap@{ub}
@{b}--break@{ub}
@{b}--no-break@{ub}
     Control how to deal with multiplication overflow and division by
     zero.  @{b}--trap@{ub} or @{b}--no-break@{ub} (which are synonyms) take a trap
     exception (and only work for Instruction Set Architecture level 2
     and higher); @{b}--break@{ub} or @{b}--no-trap@{ub} (also synonyms, and the default)
     take a break exception.

Structure of this Manual
========================

   This manual is intended to describe what you need to know to use GNU
@{b}as@{ub}.  We cover the syntax expected in source files, including notation
for symbols, constants, and expressions; the directives that @{b}as@{ub}
understands; and of course how to invoke @{b}as@{ub}.

   This manual also describes some of the machine-dependent features of
various flavors of the assembler.

   On the other hand, this manual is @{i}not@{ui} intended as an introduction to
programming in assembly language--let alone programming in general!  In
a similar vein, we make no attempt to introduce the machine
architecture; we do @{i}not@{ui} describe the instruction set, standard
mnemonics, registers or addressing modes that are standard to a
particular architecture.  You may want to consult the manufacturer's
machine architecture manual for this information.

The GNU Assembler
=================

   GNU @{b}as@{ub} is really a family of assemblers.  If you use (or have used)
the GNU assembler on one architecture, you should find a fairly similar
environment when you use it on another architecture.  Each version has
much in common with the others, including object file formats, most
assembler directives (often called @{i}pseudo-ops@{ui}) and assembler syntax.

@{b}   as@{ub} is primarily intended to assemble the output of the GNU C
compiler @{b}gcc@{ub} for use by the linker @{b}ld@{ub}.  Nevertheless, we've tried to
make @{b}as@{ub} assemble correctly everything that other assemblers for the same
machine would assemble.  Any exceptions are documented explicitly (see
@{"Machine Dependencies" link "Machine Dependencies"}).  This doesn't mean @{b}as@{ub} always uses the same
syntax as another assembler for the same architecture; for example, we
know of several incompatible versions of 680x0 assembly language syntax.

   Unlike older assemblers, @{b}as@{ub} is designed to assemble a source program
in one pass of the source file.  This has a subtle impact on the @{b}.org@{ub}
directive (see @{".org" link "Org"}).

@node "Object Formats" "as.guide/Object Formats"

@toc "Overview"

Object File Formats
===================

   The GNU assembler can be configured to produce several alternative
object file formats.  For the most part, this does not affect how you
write assembly language programs; but directives for debugging symbols
are typically different in different file formats.  See
@{"Symbol Attributes" link "Symbol Attributes"}.


@endnode

@node "Command Line" "as.guide/Command Line"
@next "Input Files"
@prev "Object Formats"
@toc "Overview"

Command Line
============

   After the program name @{b}as@{ub}, the command line may contain options and
file names.  Options may appear in any order, and may be before, after,
or between file names.  The order of file names is significant.

@{b}   --@{ub} (two hyphens) by itself names the standard input file explicitly,
as one of the files for @{b}as@{ub} to assemble.

   Except for @{b}--@{ub} any command line argument that begins with a hyphen
(@{b}-@{ub}) is an option.  Each option changes the behavior of @{b}as@{ub}.  No option
changes the way another option works.  An option is a @{b}-@{ub} followed by one
or more letters; the case of the letter is important.   All options are
optional.

   Some options expect exactly one file name to follow them.  The file
name may either immediately follow the option's letter (compatible with
older assemblers) or it may be the next command argument (GNU
standard).  These two command lines are equivalent:

     as -o my-object-file.o mumble.s
     as -omy-object-file.o mumble.s


@endnode

@node "Input Files" "as.guide/Input Files"
@next "Object"
@prev "Command Line"
@toc "Overview"

Input Files
===========

   We use the phrase @{i}source program@{ui}, abbreviated @{i}source@{ui}, to describe
the program input to one run of @{b}as@{ub}.  The program may be in one or more
files; how the source is partitioned into files doesn't change the
meaning of the source.

   The source program is a concatenation of the text in all the files,
in the order specified.

   Each time you run @{b}as@{ub} it assembles exactly one source program.  The
source program is made up of one or more files.  (The standard input is
also a file.)

   You give @{b}as@{ub} a command line that has zero or more input file names.
The input files are read (from left file name to right).  A command
line argument (in any position) that has no special meaning is taken to
be an input file name.

   If you give @{b}as@{ub} no file names it attempts to read one input file from
the @{b}as@{ub} standard input, which is normally your terminal.  You may have
to type <ctl-D> to tell @{b}as@{ub} there is no more program to assemble.

   Use @{b}--@{ub} if you need to explicitly name the standard input file in
your command line.

   If the source is empty, @{b}as@{ub} produces a small, empty object file.

Filenames and Line-numbers
--------------------------

   There are two ways of locating a line in the input file (or files)
and either may be used in reporting error messages.  One way refers to
a line number in a physical file; the other refers to a line number in a
"logical" file.  See @{"Error and Warning Messages" link "Errors"}.

@{i}   Physical files@{ui} are those files named in the command line given to @{b}as@{ub}.

@{i}   Logical files@{ui} are simply names declared explicitly by assembler
directives; they bear no relation to physical files.  Logical file names
help error messages reflect the original source file, when @{b}as@{ub} source is
itself synthesized from other files.  See @{".app-file" link "App-File"}.


@endnode

@node "Object" "as.guide/Object"
@next "Errors"
@prev "Input Files"
@toc "Overview"

Output (Object) File
====================

   Every time you run @{b}as@{ub} it produces an output file, which is your
assembly language program translated into numbers.  This file is the
object file.  Its default name is @{b}a.out@{ub}, or @{b}b.out@{ub} when @{b}as@{ub} is configured
for the Intel 80960.  You can give it another name by using the @{b}-o@{ub}
option.  Conventionally, object file names end with @{b}.o@{ub}.  The default
name is used for historical reasons: older assemblers were capable of
assembling self-contained programs directly into a runnable program.
(For some formats, this isn't currently possible, but it can be done
for the @{b}a.out@{ub} format.)

   The object file is meant for input to the linker @{b}ld@{ub}.  It contains
assembled program code, information to help @{b}ld@{ub} integrate the assembled
program into a runnable file, and (optionally) symbolic information for
the debugger.


@endnode

@node "Errors" "as.guide/Errors"
@prev "Object"
@toc "Overview"

Error and Warning Messages
==========================

@{b}   as@{ub} may write warnings and error messages to the standard error file
(usually your terminal).  This should not happen when  a compiler runs
@{b}as@{ub} automatically.  Warnings report an assumption made so that @{b}as@{ub} could
keep assembling a flawed program; errors report a grave problem that
stops the assembly.

   Warning messages have the format

     file_name:@{b}NNN@{ub}:Warning Message Text

(where @{b}NNN@{ub} is a line number).  If a logical file name has been given
(see @{".app-file" link "App-File"}) it is used for the filename, otherwise the name of the
current input file is used.  If a logical line number was given (see
@{".line" link "Line"}) then it is used to calculate the number printed, otherwise the
actual line in the current source file is printed.  The message text is
intended to be self explanatory (in the grand Unix tradition).

   Error messages have the format
     file_name:@{b}NNN@{ub}:FATAL:Error Message Text
   The file name and line number are derived as for warning messages.
The actual message text may be rather less explanatory because many of
them aren't supposed to happen.

Command-Line Options
********************

   This chapter describes command-line options available in @{i}all@{ui}
versions of the GNU assembler; see @{"Machine Dependencies" link "Machine Dependencies"}, for options
specific to particular machine architectures.

   If you are invoking @{b}as@{ub} via the GNU C compiler (version 2), you can
use the @{b}-Wa@{ub} option to pass arguments through to the assembler.  The
assembler arguments must be separated from each other (and the @{b}-Wa@{ub}) by
commas.  For example:

     gcc -c -g -O -Wa,-alh,-L file.c

emits a listing to standard output with high-level and assembly source.

   Usually you do not need to use this @{b}-Wa@{ub} mechanism, since many
compiler command-line options are automatically passed to the assembler
by the compiler.  (You can call the GNU compiler driver with the @{b}-v@{ub}
option to see precisely what options it passes to each compilation
pass, including the assembler.)


 @{" a            " link "a"}  -a[cdhlns] enable listings
 @{" D            " link "D"}  -D for compatibility
 @{" f            " link "f"}  -f to work faster
 @{" I            " link "I"}  -I for .include search path

 @{" K            " link "K"}  -K for difference tables

 @{" L            " link "L"}  -L to retain local labels
 @{" M            " link "M"}  -M or -mri to assemble in MRI compatibility mode
 @{" o            " link "o"}  -o to name the object file
 @{" R            " link "R"}  -R to join data and text sections
 @{" statistics   " link "statistics"}  -statistics to see statistics about assembly
 @{" v            " link "v"}  -v to announce version
 @{" W            " link "W"}  -W to suppress warnings
 @{" Z            " link "Z"}  -Z to make object file even after errors


@endnode

@node "a" "as.guide/a"
@next "D"
@toc "Invoking"

Enable Listings: @{b}-a[cdhlns]@{ub}
===========================

   These options enable listing output from the assembler.  By itself,
@{b}-a@{ub} requests high-level, assembly, and symbols listing.  You can use
other letters to select specific options for the list: @{b}-ah@{ub} requests a
high-level language listing, @{b}-al@{ub} requests an output-program assembly
listing, and @{b}-as@{ub} requests a symbol table listing.  High-level listings
require that a compiler debugging option like @{b}-g@{ub} be used, and that
assembly listings (@{b}-al@{ub}) be requested also.

   Use the @{b}-ac@{ub} option to omit false conditionals from a listing.  Any
lines which are not assembled because of a false @{b}.if@{ub} (or @{b}.ifdef@{ub}, or any
other conditional), or a true @{b}.if@{ub} followed by an @{b}.else@{ub}, will be omitted
from the listing.

   Use the @{b}-ad@{ub} option to omit debugging directives from the listing.

   Once you have specified one of these options, you can further control
listing output and its appearance using the directives @{b}.list@{ub}, @{b}.nolist@{ub},
@{b}.psize@{ub}, @{b}.eject@{ub}, @{b}.title@{ub}, and @{b}.sbttl@{ub}.  The @{b}-an@{ub} option turns off all forms
processing.  If you do not request listing output with one of the @{b}-a@{ub}
options, the listing-control directives have no effect.

   The letters after @{b}-a@{ub} may be combined into one option, @{i}e.g.@{ui}, @{b}-aln@{ub}.

@{b}-D@{ub}

Work Faster: @{b}-f@{ub}
===============

@{b}   -f@{ub} should only be used when assembling programs written by a
(trusted) compiler.  @{b}-f@{ub} stops the assembler from doing whitespace and
comment preprocessing on the input file(s) before assembling them.  See
@{"Preprocessing" link "Preprocessing"}.

@{i}     Warning:@{ui} if you use @{b}-f@{ub} when the files actually need to be
     preprocessed (if they contain comments, for example), @{b}as@{ub} does not
     work correctly.

@{b}.include@{ub} search path: @{b}-I@{ub} PATH
=============================

   Use this option to add a PATH to the list of directories @{b}as@{ub} searches
for files specified in @{b}.include@{ub} directives (see @{".include" link "Include"}).  You may
use @{b}-I@{ub} as many times as necessary to include a variety of paths.  The
current working directory is always searched first; after that, @{b}as@{ub}
searches any @{b}-I@{ub} directories in the same order as they were specified
(left to right) on the command line.

Include Local Labels: @{b}-L@{ub}
========================

   Labels beginning with @{b}L@{ub} (upper case only) are called @{i}local labels@{ui}.
See @{"Symbol Names" link "Symbol Names"}.  Normally you do not see such labels when debugging,
because they are intended for the use of programs (like compilers) that
compose assembler programs, not for your notice.  Normally both @{b}as@{ub} and
@{b}ld@{ub} discard such labels, so you do not normally debug with them.

   This option tells @{b}as@{ub} to retain those @{b}L...@{ub} symbols in the object
file.  Usually if you do this you also tell the linker @{b}ld@{ub} to preserve
symbols whose names begin with @{b}L@{ub}.

   By default, a local label is any label beginning with @{b}L@{ub}, but each
target is allowed to redefine the local label prefix.  On the HPPA
local labels begin with @{b}L$@{ub}.

Assemble in MRI Compatibility Mode: @{b}-M@{ub}
======================================

   The @{b}-M@{ub} or @{b}--mri@{ub} option selects MRI compatibility mode.  This changes
the syntax and pseudo-op handling of @{b}as@{ub} to make it compatible with the
@{b}ASM68K@{ub} or the @{b}ASM960@{ub} (depending upon the configured target) assembler
from Microtec Research.  The exact nature of the MRI syntax will not be
documented here; see the MRI manuals for more information.  Note in
particular that the handling of macros and macro arguments is somewhat
different.  The purpose of this option is to permit assembling existing
MRI assembler code using @{b}as@{ub}.

   The MRI compatibility is not complete.  Certain operations of the
MRI assembler depend upon its object file format, and can not be
supported using other object file formats.  Supporting these would
require enhancing each object file format individually.  These are:

   * global symbols in common section

     The m68k MRI assembler supports common sections which are merged
     by the linker.  Other object file formats do not support this.  @{b}as@{ub}
     handles common sections by treating them as a single common
     symbol.  It permits local symbols to be defined within a common
     section, but it can not support global symbols, since it has no
     way to describe them.

   * complex relocations

     The MRI assemblers support relocations against a negated section
     address, and relocations which combine the start addresses of two
     or more sections.  These are not support by other object file
     formats.

   * @{b}END@{ub} pseudo-op specifying start address

     The MRI @{b}END@{ub} pseudo-op permits the specification of a start address.
     This is not supported by other object file formats.  The start
     address may instead be specified using the @{b}-e@{ub} option to the
     linker, or in a linker script.

   * @{b}IDNT@{ub}, @{b}.ident@{ub} and @{b}NAME@{ub} pseudo-ops

     The MRI @{b}IDNT@{ub}, @{b}.ident@{ub} and @{b}NAME@{ub} pseudo-ops assign a module name to
     the output file.  This is not supported by other object file
     formats.

   * @{b}ORG@{ub} pseudo-op

     The m68k MRI @{b}ORG@{ub} pseudo-op begins an absolute section at a given
     address.  This differs from the usual @{b}as@{ub} @{b}.org@{ub} pseudo-op, which
     changes the location within the current section.  Absolute
     sections are not supported by other object file formats.  The
     address of a section may be assigned within a linker script.

   There are some other features of the MRI assembler which are not
supported by @{b}as@{ub}, typically either because they are difficult or because
they seem of little consequence.  Some of these may be supported in
future releases.

   * EBCDIC strings

     EBCDIC strings are not supported.

   * packed binary coded decimal

     Packed binary coded decimal is not supported.  This means that the
     @{b}DC.P@{ub} and @{b}DCB.P@{ub} pseudo-ops are not supported.

   * @{b}FEQU@{ub} pseudo-op

     The m68k @{b}FEQU@{ub} pseudo-op is not supported.

   * @{b}NOOBJ@{ub} pseudo-op

     The m68k @{b}NOOBJ@{ub} pseudo-op is not supported.

   * @{b}OPT@{ub} branch control options

     The m68k @{b}OPT@{ub} branch control options--@{b}B@{ub}, @{b}BRS@{ub}, @{b}BRB@{ub}, @{b}BRL@{ub}, and
     @{b}BRW@{ub}--are ignored.  @{b}as@{ub} automatically relaxes all branches, whether
     forward or backward, to an appropriate size, so these options
     serve no purpose.

   * @{b}OPT@{ub} list control options

     The following m68k @{b}OPT@{ub} list control options are ignored: @{b}C@{ub}, @{b}CEX@{ub},
     @{b}CL@{ub}, @{b}CRE@{ub}, @{b}E@{ub}, @{b}G@{ub}, @{b}I@{ub}, @{b}M@{ub}, @{b}MEX@{ub}, @{b}MC@{ub}, @{b}MD@{ub}, @{b}X@{ub}.

   * other @{b}OPT@{ub} options

     The following m68k @{b}OPT@{ub} options are ignored: @{b}NEST@{ub}, @{b}O@{ub}, @{b}OLD@{ub}, @{b}OP@{ub}, @{b}P@{ub},
     @{b}PCO@{ub}, @{b}PCR@{ub}, @{b}PCS@{ub}, @{b}R@{ub}.

   * @{b}OPT@{ub} @{b}D@{ub} option is default

     The m68k @{b}OPT@{ub} @{b}D@{ub} option is the default, unlike the MRI assembler.
     @{b}OPT NOD@{ub} may be used to turn it off.

   * @{b}XREF@{ub} pseudo-op.

     The m68k @{b}XREF@{ub} pseudo-op is ignored.

   * @{b}.debug@{ub} pseudo-op

     The i960 @{b}.debug@{ub} pseudo-op is not supported.

   * @{b}.extended@{ub} pseudo-op

     The i960 @{b}.extended@{ub} pseudo-op is not supported.

   * @{b}.list@{ub} pseudo-op.

     The various options of the i960 @{b}.list@{ub} pseudo-op are not supported.

   * @{b}.optimize@{ub} pseudo-op

     The i960 @{b}.optimize@{ub} pseudo-op is not supported.

   * @{b}.output@{ub} pseudo-op

     The i960 @{b}.output@{ub} pseudo-op is not supported.

   * @{b}.setreal@{ub} pseudo-op

     The i960 @{b}.setreal@{ub} pseudo-op is not supported.

Name the Object File: @{b}-o@{ub}
========================

   There is always one object file output when you run @{b}as@{ub}.  By default
it has the name @{b}a.out@{ub} (or @{b}b.out@{ub}, for Intel 960 targets only).  You use
this option (which takes exactly one filename) to give the object file
a different name.

   Whatever the object file is called, @{b}as@{ub} overwrites any existing file
of the same name.

Join Data and Text Sections: @{b}-R@{ub}
===============================

@{b}   -R@{ub} tells @{b}as@{ub} to write the object file as if all data-section data
lives in the text section.  This is only done at the very last moment:
your binary data are the same, but data section parts are relocated
differently.  The data section part of your object file is zero bytes
long because all its bytes are appended to the text section.  (See
@{"Sections and Relocation" link "Sections"}.)

   When you specify @{b}-R@{ub} it would be possible to generate shorter address
displacements (because we do not have to cross between text and data
section).  We refrain from doing this simply for compatibility with
older versions of @{b}as@{ub}.  In future, @{b}-R@{ub} may work this way.

   When @{b}as@{ub} is configured for COFF output, this option is only useful if
you use sections named @{b}.text@{ub} and @{b}.data@{ub}.

@{b}   -R@{ub} is not supported for any of the HPPA targets.  Using @{b}-R@{ub} generates
a warning from @{b}as@{ub}.

seconds).

Suppress Warnings: @{b}-W@{ub}
=====================

@{b}   as@{ub} should never give a warning or error message when assembling
compiler output.  But programs written by people often cause @{b}as@{ub} to give
a warning that a particular assumption was made.  All such warnings are
directed to the standard error file.  If you use this option, no
warnings are issued.  This option only affects the warning messages: it
does not change any particular of how @{b}as@{ub} assembles your file.  Errors,
which stop the assembly, are still reported.

reason you are interested in object file output even after @{b}as@{ub} gives an
error message on your program, use the @{b}-Z@{ub} option.  If there are any
errors, @{b}as@{ub} continues anyways, and writes an object file after a final
warning message of the form @{b}N errors, M warnings, generating bad object
file.@{ub}

Syntax
******

   This chapter describes the machine-independent syntax allowed in a
source file.  @{b}as@{ub} syntax is similar to what many other assemblers use;
it is inspired by the BSD 4.2 assembler, except that @{b}as@{ub} does not
assemble Vax bit-fields.

@toc "Syntax"

Preprocessing
=============

   The @{b}as@{ub} internal preprocessor:
   * adjusts and removes extra whitespace.  It leaves one space or tab
     before the keywords on a line, and turns any other whitespace on
     the line into a single space.

   * removes all comments, replacing them with a single space, or an
     appropriate number of newlines.

   * converts character constants into the appropriate numeric values.

   It does not do macro processing, include file handling, or anything
else you may get from your C compiler's preprocessor.  You can do
include file processing with the @{b}.include@{ub} directive (see @{".include" link "Include"}).
You can use the GNU C compiler driver to get other "CPP" style
preprocessing, by giving the input file a @{b}.S@{ub} suffix.  See
@{"Options Controlling the Kind of Output" link "gcc.guide/Overall Options"}.

   Excess whitespace, comments, and character constants cannot be used
in the portions of the input text that are not preprocessed.

   If the first line of an input file is @{b}#NO_APP@{ub} or if you use the @{b}-f@{ub}
option, whitespace and comments are not removed from the input file.
Within an input file, you can ask for whitespace and comment removal in
specific portions of the by putting a line that says @{b}#APP@{ub} before the
text that may contain whitespace or comments, and putting a line that
says @{b}#NO_APP@{ub} after this text.  This feature is mainly intend to support
@{b}asm@{ub} statements in compilers whose output is otherwise free of comments
and whitespace.

@node "Whitespace" "as.guide/Whitespace"

@toc "Syntax"

Whitespace
==========

@{i}   Whitespace@{ui} is one or more blanks or tabs, in any order.  Whitespace
is used to separate symbols, and to make programs neater for people to
read.  Unless within character constants (see @{"Character Constants" link "Characters"}),
any whitespace means the same as exactly one space.


@endnode

@node "Comments" "as.guide/Comments"
@next "Symbol Intro"
@prev "Whitespace"
@toc "Syntax"

Comments
========

   There are two ways of rendering comments to @{b}as@{ub}.  In both cases the
comment is equivalent to one space.

   Anything from @{b}/*@{ub} through the next @{b}*/@{ub} is a comment.  This means you
may not nest these comments.

     /*
       The only way to include a newline ('\\n') in a comment
       is to use this sort of comment.
     */
     
     /* This sort of comment does not nest. */

   Anything from the @{i}line comment@{ui} character to the next newline is
considered a comment and is ignored.  The line comment character is @{b};@{ub}
for the AMD 29K family; @{b};@{ub} for the H8/300 family; @{b}!@{ub} for the H8/500
family; @{b};@{ub} for the HPPA; @{b}#@{ub} on the i960; @{b}!@{ub} for the Hitachi SH; @{b}!@{ub} on the
SPARC; @{b}|@{ub} on the 680x0; @{b}#@{ub} on the Vax; @{b}!@{ub} for the Z8000; see
@{"Machine Dependencies" link "Machine Dependencies"}.

   On some machines there are two different line comment characters.
One character only begins a comment if it is the first non-whitespace
character on a line, while the other always begins a comment.

   To be compatible with past assemblers, lines that begin with @{b}#@{ub} have a
special interpretation.  Following the @{b}#@{ub} should be an absolute
expression (see @{"Expressions" link "Expressions"}): the logical line number of the @{i}next@{ui}
line.  Then a string (see @{"Strings" link "Strings"}) is allowed: if present it is a new
logical file name.  The rest of the line, if any, should be whitespace.

   If the first non-whitespace characters on the line are not numeric,
the line is ignored.  (Just like a comment.)

                               # This is an ordinary comment.
     # 42-6 "new_file_name"    # New logical file name
                               # This is logical line # 36.
   This feature is deprecated, and may disappear from future versions
of @{b}as@{ub}.

@node "Symbol Intro" "as.guide/Symbol Intro"

@toc "Syntax"

Symbols
=======

   A @{i}symbol@{ui} is one or more characters chosen from the set of all
letters (both upper and lower case), digits and the three characters
@{b}_.$@{ub}.  On most machines, you can also use @{b}$@{ub} in symbol names; exceptions
are noted in @{"Machine Dependencies" link "Machine Dependencies"}.  No symbol may begin with a digit.
Case is significant.  There is no length limit: all characters are
significant.  Symbols are delimited by characters not in that set, or
by the beginning of a file (since the source program must end with a
newline, the end of a file is not a possible symbol delimiter).  See
@{"Symbols" link "Symbols"}.


@endnode

@node "Statements" "as.guide/Statements"
@next "Constants"
@prev "Symbol Intro"
@toc "Syntax"

Statements
==========

   A @{i}statement@{ui} ends at a newline character (@{b}\\n@{ub}) or line separator
character.  (The line separator is usually @{b};@{ub}, unless this conflicts
with the comment character; see @{"Machine Dependencies" link "Machine Dependencies"}.)  The newline or
separator character is considered part of the preceding statement.
Newlines and separators within character constants are an exception:
they do not end statements.

   It is an error to end any statement with end-of-file:  the last
character of any input file should be a newline.

   You may write a statement on more than one line if you put a
backslash (@{b}\\ @{ub}) immediately in front of any newlines within the
statement.  When @{b}as@{ub} reads a backslashed newline both characters are
ignored.  You can even put backslashed newlines in the middle of symbol
names without changing the meaning of your source program.

   An empty statement is allowed, and may include whitespace.  It is
ignored.

   A statement begins with zero or more labels, optionally followed by a
key symbol which determines what kind of statement it is.  The key
symbol determines the syntax of the rest of the statement.  If the
symbol begins with a dot @{b}.@{ub} then the statement is an assembler
directive: typically valid for any computer.  If the symbol begins with
a letter the statement is an assembly language @{i}instruction@{ui}: it
assembles into a machine language instruction.  Different versions of
@{b}as@{ub} for different computers recognize different instructions.  In fact,
the same symbol may represent a different instruction in a different
computer's assembly language.

   A label is a symbol immediately followed by a colon (@{b}:@{ub}).  Whitespace
before a label or after a colon is permitted, but you may not have
whitespace between a label's symbol and its colon. See @{"Labels" link "Labels"}.

   For HPPA targets, labels need not be immediately followed by a
colon, but the definition of a label must begin in column zero.  This
also implies that only one label may be defined on each line.

     label:     .directive    followed by something
     another_label:           # This is an empty statement.

   There are two kinds of character constants.  A @{i}character@{ui} stands for

potentially many bytes and their values may not be used in arithmetic

Strings
.......

   A @{i}string@{ui} is written between double-quotes.  It may contain
double-quotes or null characters.  The way to get special characters
into a string is to @{i}escape@{ui} these characters: precede them with a
backslash @{b}\\ @{ub} character.  For example @{b}\\\\ @{ub} represents one backslash:
the first @{b}\\ @{ub} is an escape which tells @{b}as@{ub} to interpret the second
character literally as a backslash (which prevents @{b}as@{ub} from recognizing
the second @{b}\\ @{ub} as an escape character).  The complete list of escapes
follows.

@{b}\\b@{ub}
     Mnemonic for backspace; for ASCII this is octal code 010.

@{b}\\f@{ub}
     Mnemonic for FormFeed; for ASCII this is octal code 014.

@{b}\\n@{ub}
     Mnemonic for newline; for ASCII this is octal code 012.

@{b}\\r@{ub}
     Mnemonic for carriage-Return; for ASCII this is octal code 015.

@{b}\\t@{ub}
     Mnemonic for horizontal Tab; for ASCII this is octal code 011.

@{b}\\ DIGIT DIGIT DIGIT@{ub}
     An octal character code.  The numeric code is 3 octal digits.  For
     compatibility with other Unix systems, 8 and 9 are accepted as
     digits: for example, @{b}\\008@{ub} has the value 010, and @{b}\\009@{ub} the value
     011.

@{b}\\@{b}x@{ub} HEX-DIGITS...@{ub}
     A hex character code.  All trailing hex digits are combined.
     Either upper or lower case @{b}x@{ub} works.

@{b}\\\\ @{ub}
     Represents one @{b}\\ @{ub} character.

@{b}\\"@{ub}
     Represents one @{b}"@{ub} character.  Needed in strings to represent this
     character, because an unescaped @{b}"@{ub} would end the string.

@{b}\\ ANYTHING-ELSE@{ub}
     Any other character when escaped by @{b}\\ @{ub} gives a warning, but
     assembles as if the @{b}\\ @{ub} was not present.  The idea is that if you
     used an escape sequence you clearly didn't want the literal
     interpretation of the following character.  However @{b}as@{ub} has no
     other interpretation, so @{b}as@{ub} knows it is giving you the wrong code
     and warns you of the fact.

   Which characters are escapable, and what those escapes represent,
varies widely among assemblers.  The current set is what we think the
BSD 4.2 assembler recognizes, and is a subset of what most C compilers
recognize.  If you are in doubt, do not use an escape sequence.


@endnode

@node "Chars" "as.guide/Chars"
@prev "Strings"
@toc "Characters"

Characters
..........

   A single character may be written as a single quote immediately
followed by that character.  The same escapes apply to characters as to
strings.  So if you want to write the character backslash, you must
write @{b}'\\\\ @{ub} where the first @{b}\\ @{ub} escapes the second @{b}\\ @{ub}.  As you can
see, the quote is an acute accent, not a grave accent.  A newline
immediately following an acute accent is taken as a literal character
and does not count as the end of a statement.  The value of a character
constant in a numeric expression is the machine's byte-wide code for
that character.  @{b}as@{ub} assumes your character code is ASCII: @{b}'A@{ub} means 65,
@{b}'B@{ub} means 66, and so on.

precision.  This generic floating point number is converted to a
particular computer's floating point format (or formats) by a portion
of @{b}as@{ub} specialized to that computer.

   A flonum is written by writing (in order)
   * The digit @{b}0@{ub}.  (@{b}0@{ub} is optional on the HPPA.)

   * A letter, to tell @{b}as@{ub} the rest of the number is a flonum.  @{b}e@{ub} is
     recommended.  Case is not important.

     On the H8/300, H8/500, Hitachi SH, and AMD 29K architectures, the
     letter must be one of the letters @{b}DFPRSX@{ub} (in upper or lower case).

     On the Intel 960 architecture, the letter must be one of the
     letters @{b}DFT@{ub} (in upper or lower case).

     On the HPPA architecture, the letter must be @{b}E@{ub} (upper case only).

   * An optional sign: either @{b}+@{ub} or @{b}-@{ub}.

   * An optional @{i}integer part@{ui}: zero or more decimal digits.

   * An optional @{i}fractional part@{ui}: @{b}.@{ub} followed by zero or more decimal
     digits.

   * An optional exponent, consisting of:

        * An @{b}E@{ub} or @{b}e@{ub}.

        * Optional sign: either @{b}+@{ub} or @{b}-@{ub}.

        * One or more decimal digits.

   At least one of the integer part or the fractional part must be
present.  The floating point number has the usual base-10 value.

@{b}   as@{ub} does all processing using integers.  Flonums are computed
independently of any floating point hardware in the computer running @{b}as@{ub}.

Background
==========

   Roughly, a section is a range of addresses, with no gaps; all data
"in" those addresses is treated the same for some particular purpose.
For example there may be a "read only" section.

   The linker @{b}ld@{ub} reads many object files (partial programs) and
combines their contents to form a runnable program.  When @{b}as@{ub} emits an
object file, the partial program is assumed to start at address 0.  @{b}ld@{ub}
assigns the final addresses for the partial program, so that different
partial programs do not overlap.  This is actually an
oversimplification, but it suffices to explain how @{b}as@{ub} uses sections.

@{b}   ld@{ub} moves blocks of bytes of your program to their run-time
addresses.  These blocks slide to their run-time addresses as rigid
units; their length does not change and neither does the order of bytes
within them.  Such a rigid unit is called a @{i}section@{ui}.  Assigning
run-time addresses to sections is called @{i}relocation@{ui}.  It includes the
task of adjusting mentions of object-file addresses so they refer to
the proper run-time addresses.  For the H8/300 and H8/500, and for the
Hitachi SH, @{b}as@{ub} pads sections if needed to ensure they end on a word
(sixteen bit) boundary.

   An object file written by @{b}as@{ub} has at least three sections, any of
which may be empty.  These are named @{i}text@{ui}, @{i}data@{ui} and @{i}bss@{ui} sections.

   When it generates COFF output, @{b}as@{ub} can also generate whatever other
named sections you specify using the @{b}.section@{ub} directive (see @{".section" link "Section"}).
If you do not use any directives that place output in the @{b}.text@{ub} or
@{b}.data@{ub} sections, these sections still exist, but are empty.

   When @{b}as@{ub} generates SOM or ELF output for the HPPA, @{b}as@{ub} can also
generate whatever other named sections you specify using the @{b}.space@{ub} and
@{b}.subspace@{ub} directives.  See `HP9000 Series 800 Assembly Language
Reference Manual' (HP 92432-90001) for details on the @{b}.space@{ub} and
@{b}.subspace@{ub} assembler directives.

   Additionally, @{b}as@{ub} uses different names for the standard text, data,
and bss sections when generating SOM output.  Program text is placed
into the @{b}$CODE$@{ub} section, data into @{b}$DATA$@{ub}, and BSS into @{b}$BSS$@{ub}.

   Within the object file, the text section starts at address @{b}0@{ub}, the
data section follows, and the bss section follows the data section.

   When generating either SOM or ELF output files on the HPPA, the text
section starts at address @{b}0@{ub}, the data section at address @{b}0x4000000@{ub}, and
the bss section follows the data section.

   To let @{b}ld@{ub} know which data changes when the sections are relocated,
and how to change that data, @{b}as@{ub} also writes to the object file details
of the relocation needed.  To perform relocation @{b}ld@{ub} must know, each
time an address in the object file is mentioned:
   * Where in the object file is the beginning of this reference to an
     address?

   * How long (in bytes) is this reference?

   * Which section does the address refer to?  What is the numeric
     value of
          (ADDRESS) - (START-ADDRESS OF SECTION)?

   * Is the reference to an address "Program-Counter relative"?

   In fact, every address @{b}as@{ub} ever uses is expressed as
     (SECTION) + (OFFSET INTO SECTION)

Further, most expressions @{b}as@{ub} computes have this section-relative nature.
(For some object formats, such as SOM for the HPPA, some expressions are
symbol-relative instead.)

   In this manual we use the notation {SECNAME N} to mean "offset N
into section SECNAME."

   Apart from text, data and bss sections you need to know about the
@{i}absolute@{ui} section.  When @{b}ld@{ub} mixes partial programs, addresses in the
absolute section remain unchanged.  For example, address @{b}{absolute 0}@{ub}
is "relocated" to run-time address 0 by @{b}ld@{ub}.  Although the linker never
arranges two partial programs' data sections with overlapping addresses
after linking, @{i}by definition@{ui} their absolute sections must overlap.
Address @{b}{absolute 239}@{ub} in one part of a program is always the same
address when the program is running as address @{b}{absolute 239}@{ub} in any
other part of the program.

   The idea of sections is extended to the @{i}undefined@{ui} section.  Any
address whose section is unknown at assembly time is by definition
rendered {undefined U}--where U is filled in later.  Since numbers are
always defined, the only way to generate an undefined address is to
mention an undefined symbol.  A reference to a named common block would
be such a symbol: its value is unknown at assembly time so it has
section @{i}undefined@{ui}.

   By analogy the word @{i}section@{ui} is used to describe groups of sections in
the linked program.  @{b}ld@{ub} puts all partial programs' text sections in
contiguous addresses in the linked program.  It is customary to refer
to the @{i}text section@{ui} of a program, meaning all the addresses of all
partial programs' text sections.  Likewise for data and bss sections.

   Some sections are manipulated by @{b}ld@{ub}; others are invented for use of
@{b}as@{ub} and have no meaning except during assembly.

Linker Sections
===============

@{b}   ld@{ub} deals with just four kinds of sections, summarized below.

@{b}named sections@{ub}
@{b}text section@{ub}
@{b}data section@{ub}
     These sections hold your program.  @{b}as@{ub} and @{b}ld@{ub} treat them as
     separate but equal sections.  Anything you can say of one section
     is true another.  When the program is running, however, it is
     customary for the text section to be unalterable.  The text
     section is often shared among processes: it contains instructions,
     constants and the like.  The data section of a running program is
     usually alterable: for example, C variables would be stored in the
     data section.

@{b}bss section@{ub}
     This section contains zeroed bytes when your program begins
     running.  It is used to hold unitialized variables or common
     storage.  The length of each partial program's bss section is
     important, but because it starts out containing zeroed bytes there
     is no need to store explicit zero bytes in the object file.  The
     bss section was invented to eliminate those explicit zeros from
     object files.

@{b}absolute section@{ub}
     Address 0 of this section is always "relocated" to runtime address
     0.  This is useful if you want to refer to an address that @{b}ld@{ub} must
     not change when relocating.  In this sense we speak of absolute
     addresses being "unrelocatable": they do not change during
     relocation.

@{b}undefined section@{ub}
     This "section" is a catch-all for address references to objects
     not in the preceding sections.

   An idealized example of three relocatable sections follows.  The
example uses the traditional section names @{b}.text@{ub} and @{b}.data@{ub}.  Memory
addresses are on the horizontal axis.

                           +-----+----+--+

Assembler Internal Sections
===========================

   These sections are meant only for the internal use of @{b}as@{ub}.  They have
no meaning at run-time.  You do not really need to know about these
sections for most purposes; but they can be mentioned in @{b}as@{ub} warning
messages, so it might be helpful to have an idea of their meanings to
@{b}as@{ub}.  These sections are used to permit the value of every expression in
your assembly language program to be a section-relative address.

@{b}ASSEMBLER-INTERNAL-LOGIC-ERROR!@{ub}
     An internal assembler logic error has been found.  This means
     there is a bug in the assembler.

@{b}expr section@{ub}
     The assembler stores complex expression internally as combinations
     of symbols.  When it needs to represent an expression as a symbol,
     it puts it in the expr section.


@endnode

@node "Sub-Sections" "as.guide/Sub-Sections"
@next "bss"
@prev "As Sections"
@toc "Sections"

Sub-Sections
============

   Assembled bytes conventionally fall into two sections: text and data.
You may have separate groups of data in named sections that you want to
end up near to each other in the object file, even though they are not
contiguous in the assembler source.  @{b}as@{ub} allows you to use @{i}subsections@{ui}
for this purpose.  Within each section, there can be numbered
subsections with values from 0 to 8192.  Objects assembled into the
same subsection go into the object file together with other objects in
the same subsection.  For example, a compiler might want to store
constants in the text section, but might not want to have them
interspersed with the program being assembled.  In this case, the
compiler could issue a @{b}.text 0@{ub} before each section of code being
output, and a @{b}.text 1@{ub} before each group of constants being output.

   Subsections are optional.  If you do not use subsections, everything
goes in subsection number zero.

   Each subsection is zero-padded up to a multiple of four bytes.
(Subsections may be padded a different amount on different flavors of
@{b}as@{ub}.)

   Subsections appear in your object file in numeric order, lowest
numbered to highest.  (All this to be compatible with other people's
assemblers.)  The object file contains no representation of
subsections; @{b}ld@{ub} and other programs that manipulate object files see no
trace of them.  They just see all your text subsections as a text
section, and all your data subsections as a data section.

   To specify which subsection you want subsequent statements assembled
into, use a numeric argument to specify it, in a @{b}.text EXPRESSION@{ub} or a
@{b}.data EXPRESSION@{ub} statement.  When generating COFF output, you can also
use an extra subsection argument with arbitrary named sections:
@{b}.section NAME, EXPRESSION@{ub}.  EXPRESSION should be an absolute expression.
(See @{"Expressions" link "Expressions"}.)  If you just say @{b}.text@{ub} then @{b}.text 0@{ub} is assumed.
Likewise @{b}.data@{ub} means @{b}.data 0@{ub}.  Assembly begins in @{b}text 0@{ub}.  For instance:
     .text 0     # The default subsection is text 0 anyway.
     .ascii "This lives in the first text subsection. *"
     .text 1
     .ascii "But this lives in the second text subsection."
     .data 0
     .ascii "This lives in the data section,"
     .ascii "in the first data subsection."
     .text 0
     .ascii "This lives in the first text section,"
     .ascii "immediately following the asterisk (*)."

   Each section has a @{i}location counter@{ui} incremented by one for every byte
assembled into that section.  Because subsections are merely a
convenience restricted to @{b}as@{ub} there is no concept of a subsection
location counter.  There is no way to directly manipulate a location
counter--but the @{b}.align@{ub} directive changes it, and any label definition
captures its current value.  The location counter of the section where
statements are being assembled is said to be the @{i}active@{ui} location
counter.

@node "bss" "as.guide/bss"
@prev "Sub-Sections"
@toc "Sections"

bss Section
===========

   The bss section is used for local common variable storage.  You may
allocate address space in the bss section, but you may not dictate data
to load into it before your program executes.  When your program starts
running, all the contents of the bss section are zeroed bytes.

   The @{b}.lcomm@{ub} pseudo-op defines a symbol in the bss section; see
@{".lcomm" link "Lcomm"}.

   The @{b}.comm@{ub} pseudo-op may be used to declare a common symbol, which is
another form of uninitialized symbol; see See @{".comm" link "Comm"}.

   When assembling for a target which supports multiple sections, such
as ELF or COFF, you may switch into the @{b}.bss@{ub} section and define symbols
as usual; see @{".section" link "Section"}.  You may only assemble zero values into the
section.  Typically the section will only contain symbol definitions and
@{b}.skip@{ub} directives (see @{".skip" link "Skip"}).

Symbols
*******

   Symbols are a central concept: the programmer uses symbols to name
things, the linker uses symbols to link, and the debugger uses symbols
to debug.

@{i}     Warning:@{ui} @{b}as@{ub} does not place symbols in the object file in the same
     order they were declared.  This may break some debuggers.

Labels
======

   A @{i}label@{ui} is written as a symbol immediately followed by a colon @{b}:@{ub}.
The symbol then represents the current value of the active location
counter, and is, for example, a suitable instruction operand.  You are
warned if you use the same symbol to represent two different locations:
the first definition overrides any other definitions.

   On the HPPA, the usual form for a label need not be immediately
followed by a colon, but instead must start in column zero.  Only one
label may be defined on a single line.  To work around this, the HPPA
version of @{b}as@{ub} also provides a special directive @{b}.label@{ub} for defining
labels more flexibly.

@node "Setting Symbols" "as.guide/Setting Symbols"

@toc "Symbols"

Giving Symbols Other Values
===========================

   A symbol can be given an arbitrary value by writing a symbol,
followed by an equals sign @{b}=@{ub}, followed by an expression (see
@{"Expressions" link "Expressions"}).  This is equivalent to using the @{b}.set@{ub} directive.  See
@{".set" link "Set"}.


@endnode

@node "Symbol Names" "as.guide/Symbol Names"
@next "Dot"
@prev "Setting Symbols"
@toc "Symbols"

Symbol Names
============

   Symbol names begin with a letter or with one of @{b}._@{ub}.  On most
machines, you can also use @{b}$@{ub} in symbol names; exceptions are noted in
@{"Machine Dependencies" link "Machine Dependencies"}.  That character may be followed by any string
of digits, letters, dollar signs (unless otherwise noted in
@{"Machine Dependencies" link "Machine Dependencies"}), and underscores.  For the AMD 29K family, @{b}?@{ub} is
also allowed in the body of a symbol name, though not at its beginning.

   Case of letters is significant: @{b}foo@{ub} is a different symbol name than
@{b}Foo@{ub}.

   Each symbol has exactly one name.  Each name in an assembly language
program refers to exactly one symbol.  You may use that symbol name any
number of times in a program.

Local Symbol Names
------------------

   Local symbols help compilers and programmers use names temporarily.
There are ten local symbol names, which are re-used throughout the
program.  You may refer to them using the names @{b}0@{ub} @{b}1@{ub} ... @{b}9@{ub}.  To define a
local symbol, write a label of the form @{b}@{b}N@{ub}:@{ub} (where @{b}N@{ub} represents any
digit).  To refer to the most recent previous definition of that symbol
write @{b}@{b}N@{ub}b@{ub}, using the same digit as when you defined the label.  To refer
to the next definition of a local label, write @{b}@{b}N@{ub}f@{ub}--where @{b}N@{ub} gives you a
choice of 10 forward references.  The @{b}b@{ub} stands for "backwards" and the
@{b}f@{ub} stands for "forwards".

   Local symbols are not emitted by the current GNU C compiler.

   There is no restriction on how you can use these labels, but
remember that at any point in the assembly you can refer to at most 10
prior local labels and to at most 10 forward local labels.

   Local symbol names are only a notation device.  They are immediately
transformed into more conventional symbol names before the assembler
uses them.  The symbol names stored in the symbol table, appearing in
error messages and optionally emitted to the object file have these
parts:

@{b}L@{ub}
     All local labels begin with @{b}L@{ub}. Normally both @{b}as@{ub} and @{b}ld@{ub} forget
     symbols that start with @{b}L@{ub}. These labels are used for symbols you
     are never intended to see.  If you use the @{b}-L@{ub} option then @{b}as@{ub}
     retains these symbols in the object file. If you also instruct @{b}ld@{ub}
     to retain these symbols, you may use them in debugging.

@{b}DIGIT@{ub}
     If the label is written @{b}0:@{ub} then the digit is @{b}0@{ub}.  If the label is
     written @{b}1:@{ub} then the digit is @{b}1@{ub}.  And so on up through @{b}9:@{ub}.

@{b}C-A@{ub}
     This unusual character is included so you do not accidentally
     invent a symbol of the same name.  The character has ASCII value
     @{b}\\001@{ub}.

@{b}@{i}ordinal number@{ui}@{ub}
     This is a serial number to keep the labels distinct.  The first @{b}0:@{ub}
     gets the number @{b}1@{ub}; The 15th @{b}0:@{ub} gets the number @{b}15@{ub}; @{i}etc.@{ui}.  Likewise
     for the other labels @{b}1:@{ub} through @{b}9:@{ub}.

   For instance, the first @{b}1:@{ub} is named @{b}L1C-A1@{ub}, the 44th @{b}3:@{ub} is named
@{b}L3C-A44@{ub}.

@node "Dot" "as.guide/Dot"

The Special Dot Symbol
======================

   The special symbol @{b}.@{ub} refers to the current address that @{b}as@{ub} is
assembling into.  Thus, the expression @{b}melvin: .long .@{ub} defines @{b}melvin@{ub}
to contain its own address.  Assigning a value to @{b}.@{ub} is treated the same
as a @{b}.org@{ub} directive.  Thus, the expression @{b}.=.+4@{ub} is the same as saying
@{b}.space 4@{ub}.

Symbol Attributes
=================

   Every symbol has, as well as its name, the attributes "Value" and
"Type".  Depending on output format, symbols can also have auxiliary
attributes.

   If you use a symbol without defining it, @{b}as@{ub} assumes zero for all
these attributes, and probably won't warn you.  This makes the symbol
an externally defined symbol, which is generally what you would want.


 @{" Symbol Value               " link "Symbol Value"}  Value

@endnode

@node "Symbol Value" "as.guide/Symbol Value"
@next "Symbol Type"
@toc "Symbol Attributes"

Value
-----

   The value of a symbol is (usually) 32 bits.  For a symbol which
labels a location in the text, data, bss or absolute sections the value
is the number of addresses from the start of that section to the label.
Naturally for text, data and bss sections the value of a symbol changes
as @{b}ld@{ub} changes section base addresses during linking.  Absolute symbols'
values do not change during linking: that is why they are called
absolute.

   The value of an undefined symbol is treated in a special way.  If it
is 0 then the symbol is not defined in this assembler source file, and
@{b}ld@{ub} tries to determine its value from other files linked into the same
program.  You make this kind of symbol simply by mentioning a symbol
name without defining it.  A non-zero value represents a @{b}.comm@{ub} common
declaration.  The value is how much common storage to reserve, in bytes
(addresses).  The symbol refers to the first address of the allocated
storage.

Type
----

information, any flag settings indicating that a symbol is external, and
(optionally), other information for linkers and debuggers.  The exact

   The result of an expression must be an absolute number, or else an
offset into a particular section.  If an expression is not absolute,
and there is not enough information when @{b}as@{ub} sees the expression to know
its section, a second pass over the source program might be necessary
to interpret the expression--but the second pass is currently not
implemented.  @{b}as@{ub} aborts with an error message in this situation.

Empty Expressions
=================

   An empty expression has no value: it is just whitespace or null.
Wherever an absolute expression is required, you may omit the
expression, and @{b}as@{ub} assumes a value of (absolute) 0.  This is compatible
with other assemblers.

Integer Expressions
===================

   An @{i}integer expression@{ui} is one or more @{i}arguments@{ui} delimited by
@{i}operators@{ui}.

Arguments
---------

@{i}   Arguments@{ui} are symbols, numbers or subexpressions.  In other contexts
arguments are sometimes called "arithmetic operands".  In this manual,
to avoid confusing them with the "instruction operands" of the machine
language, we use the term "argument" to refer to parts of expressions
only, reserving the word "operand" to refer only to machine instruction
operands.

   Symbols are evaluated to yield {SECTION NNN} where SECTION is one of
text, data, bss, absolute, or undefined.  NNN is a signed, 2's
complement 32 bit integer.

   Numbers are usually integers.

   A number can be a flonum or bignum.  In this case, you are warned
that only the low order 32 bits are used, and @{b}as@{ub} pretends these 32 bits
are an integer.  You may write integer-manipulating instructions that
act on exotic constants, compatible with other assemblers.

   Subexpressions are a left parenthesis @{b}(@{ub} followed by an integer
expression, followed by a right parenthesis @{b})@{ub}; or a prefix operator
followed by an argument.

@node "Operators" "as.guide/Operators"
@next "Prefix Ops"
@prev "Arguments"
@toc "Integer Exprs"

Operators
---------

@{i}   Operators@{ui} are arithmetic functions, like @{b}+@{ub} or @{b}%@{ub}.  Prefix operators
are followed by an argument.  Infix operators appear between their
arguments.  Operators may be preceded and/or followed by whitespace.

@node "Prefix Ops" "as.guide/Prefix Ops"

Prefix Operator
---------------

@{b}   as@{ub} has the following @{i}prefix operators@{ui}.  They each take one argument,
which must be absolute.

@{b}-@{ub}
@{i}     Negation@{ui}.  Two's complement negation.

@{b}~@{ub}
@{i}     Complementation@{ui}.  Bitwise not.


@endnode

@node "Infix Ops" "as.guide/Infix Ops"
@prev "Prefix Ops"
@toc "Integer Exprs"

Infix Operators
---------------

@{i}   Infix operators@{ui} take two arguments, one on either side.  Operators
have precedence, but operations with equal precedence are performed left
to right.  Apart from @{b}+@{ub} or @{b}-@{ub}, both arguments must be absolute, and the
result is absolute.

  1. Highest Precedence

    @{b}*@{ub}
@{i}          Multiplication@{ui}.

    @{b}/@{ub}
@{i}          Division@{ui}.  Truncation is the same as the C operator @{b}/@{ub}

    @{b}%@{ub}
@{i}          Remainder@{ui}.

    @{b}<@{ub}
    @{b}<<@{ub}
@{i}          Shift Left@{ui}.  Same as the C operator @{b}<<@{ub}.

    @{b}>@{ub}
    @{b}>>@{ub}
@{i}          Shift Right@{ui}.  Same as the C operator @{b}>>@{ub}.

  2. Intermediate precedence

    @{b}|@{ub}
@{i}          Bitwise Inclusive Or@{ui}.

    @{b}&@{ub}
@{i}          Bitwise And@{ui}.

    @{b}^@{ub}
@{i}          Bitwise Exclusive Or@{ui}.

    @{b}!@{ub}
@{i}          Bitwise Or Not@{ui}.

  3. Lowest Precedence

    @{b}+@{ub}
@{i}          Addition@{ui}.  If either argument is absolute, the result has the
          section of the other argument.  You may not add together
          arguments from different sections.

    @{b}-@{ub}
@{i}          Subtraction@{ui}.  If the right argument is absolute, the result
          has the section of the left argument.  If both arguments are
          in the same section, the result is absolute.  You may not
          subtract arguments from different sections.

   In short, it's only meaningful to add or subtract the @{i}offsets@{ui} in an
address; you can only have a defined section in one of the two
arguments.

@{b}.abort@{ub}
======

   This directive stops the assembly immediately.  It is for
compatibility with other assemblers.  The original idea was that the
assembly language source would be piped into the assembler.  If the
sender of the source quit, it could use this directive tells @{b}as@{ub} to quit
also.  One day @{b}.abort@{ub} will not be supported.

@{b}.ABORT@{ub}
======

   When producing COFF output, @{b}as@{ub} accepts this directive as a synonym
for @{b}.abort@{ub}.

   When producing @{b}b.out@{ub} output, @{b}as@{ub} accepts this directive, but ignores
it.


@endnode

@node "Align" "as.guide/Align"
@next "App-File"
@prev "ABORT"
@toc "Pseudo Ops"

@{b}.align ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR@{ub}
===================================

   Pad the location counter (in the current subsection) to a particular
storage boundary.  The first expression (which must be absolute) is the
alignment required, as described below.

   The second expression (also absolute) gives the fill value to be
stored in the padding bytes.  It (and the comma) may be omitted.  If it
is omitted, the padding bytes are normally zero.  However, on some
systems, if the section is marked as containing code and the fill value
is omitted, the space is filled with no-op instructions.

   The third expression is also absolute, and is also optional.  If it
is present, it is the maximum number of bytes that should be skipped by
this alignment directive.  If doing the alignment would require
skipping more bytes than the specified maximum, then the alignment is
not done at all.  You can omit the fill value (the second argument)
entirely by simply using two commas after the required alignment; this
can be useful if you want the alignment to be filled with no-op
instructions when appropriate.

   The way the required alignment is specified varies from system to
system.  For the a29k, hppa, m68k, m88k, w65, sparc, and Hitachi SH,
and i386 using ELF format, the first expression is the alignment
request in bytes.  For example @{b}.align 8@{ub} advances the location counter
until it is a multiple of 8.  If the location counter is already a
multiple of 8, no change is needed.

   For other systems, including the i386 using a.out format, it is the
number of low-order zero bits the location counter must have after
advancement.  For example @{b}.align 3@{ub} advances the location counter until
it a multiple of 8.  If the location counter is already a multiple of
8, no change is needed.

   This inconsistency is due to the different behaviors of the various
native assemblers for these systems which GAS must emulate.  GAS also
provides @{b}.balign@{ub} and @{b}.p2align@{ub} directives, described later, which have a
consistent behavior across all architectures (but are specific to GAS).

@{b}.app-file STRING@{ub}
================

@{b}   .app-file@{ub} (which may also be spelled @{b}.file@{ub}) tells @{b}as@{ub} that we are
about to start a new logical file.  STRING is the new file name.  In
general, the filename is recognized whether or not it is surrounded by
quotes @{b}"@{ub}; but if you wish to specify an empty file name is permitted,
you must give the quotes-@{b}""@{ub}.  This statement may go away in future: it

@{b}.asciz "STRING"@{ub}...

@next "Byte"
@prev "Asciz"
@toc "Pseudo Ops"

@{b}.balign[wl] ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR@{ub}
========================================

   Pad the location counter (in the current subsection) to a particular
storage boundary.  The first expression (which must be absolute) is the
alignment request in bytes.  For example @{b}.balign 8@{ub} advances the
location counter until it is a multiple of 8.  If the location counter
is already a multiple of 8, no change is needed.

   The second expression (also absolute) gives the fill value to be
stored in the padding bytes.  It (and the comma) may be omitted.  If it
is omitted, the padding bytes are normally zero.  However, on some
systems, if the section is marked as containing code and the fill value
is omitted, the space is filled with no-op instructions.

   The third expression is also absolute, and is also optional.  If it
is present, it is the maximum number of bytes that should be skipped by
this alignment directive.  If doing the alignment would require
skipping more bytes than the specified maximum, then the alignment is
not done at all.  You can omit the fill value (the second argument)
entirely by simply using two commas after the required alignment; this
can be useful if you want the alignment to be filled with no-op
instructions when appropriate.

   The @{b}.balignw@{ub} and @{b}.balignl@{ub} directives are variants of the @{b}.balign@{ub}
directive.  The @{b}.balignw@{ub} directive treats the fill pattern as a two
byte word value.  The @{b}.balignl@{ub} directives treats the fill pattern as a
four byte longword value.  For example, @{b}.balignw 4,0x368d@{ub} will align to
a multiple of 4.  If it skips two bytes, they will be filled in with
the value 0x368d (the exact placement of the bytes depends upon the
endianness of the processor).  If it skips 1 or 3 bytes, the fill value
is undefined.

@node "Comm" "as.guide/Comm"
@next "Data"
@prev "Byte"
@toc "Pseudo Ops"

@{b}.comm SYMBOL , LENGTH @{ub}
======================

@{b}   .comm@{ub} declares a common symbol named SYMBOL.  When linking, a common
symbol in one object file may be merged with a defined or common symbol
of the same name in another object file.  If @{b}ld@{ub} does not see a
definition for the symbol-just one or more common symbols-then it will
allocate LENGTH bytes of uninitialized memory.  LENGTH must be an
absolute expression.  If @{b}ld@{ub} sees multiple common symbols with the same
name, and they do not all have the same size, it will allocate space
using the largest size.

   When using ELF, the @{b}.comm@{ub} directive takes an optional third argument.
This is the desired alignment of the symbol, specified as a byte
boundary (for example, an alignment of 16 means that the least
significant 4 bits of the address should be zero).  The alignment must
be an absolute expression, and it must be a power of two.  If @{b}ld@{ub}
allocates uninitialized memory for the common symbol, it will use the
alignment when placing the symbol.  If no alignment is specified, @{b}as@{ub}
will set the alignment to the largest power of two less than or equal
to the size of the symbol, up to a maximum of 16.

   The syntax for @{b}.comm@{ub} differs slightly on the HPPA.  The syntax is
@{b}SYMBOL .comm, LENGTH@{ub}; SYMBOL is optional.

@{b}.data SUBSECTION@{ub}

@{b}.endef@{ub}
======

   This directive flags the end of a symbol definition begun with @{b}.def@{ub}.

@{b}   .endef@{ub} is only meaningful when generating COFF format output; if @{b}as@{ub}
is configured to generate @{b}b.out@{ub}, it accepts this directive but ignores
it.

@{b}.equ SYMBOL, EXPRESSION@{ub}
=======================

   This directive sets the value of SYMBOL to EXPRESSION.  It is
synonymous with @{b}.set@{ub}; see @{".set" link "Set"}.

   The syntax for @{b}equ@{ub} on the HPPA is @{b}SYMBOL .equ EXPRESSION@{ub}.

@{b}.equiv SYMBOL, EXPRESSION@{ub}
=========================

   The @{b}.equiv@{ub} directive is like @{b}.equ@{ub} and @{b}.set@{ub}, except that the
assembler will signal an error if SYMBOL is already defined.

   Except for the contents of the error message, this is roughly
equivalent to
     .ifdef SYM

     .endif
     .equ SYM,VAL

@{b}.err@{ub}
====

   If @{b}as@{ub} assembles a @{b}.err@{ub} directive, it will print an error message

@{b}.extern@{ub}

@{b}.file STRING@{ub}
============

@{b}   .file@{ub} (which may also be spelled @{b}.app-file@{ub}) tells @{b}as@{ub} that we are
about to start a new logical file.  STRING is the new file name.  In
general, the filename is recognized whether or not it is surrounded by
quotes @{b}"@{ub}; but if you wish to specify an empty file name, you must give
the quotes-@{b}""@{ub}.  This statement may go away in future: it is only
recognized to be compatible with old @{b}as@{ub} programs.  In some
configurations of @{b}as@{ub}, @{b}.file@{ub} has already been removed to avoid conflicts
with other assemblers.  See @{"Machine Dependencies" link "Machine Dependencies"}.

@node "Fill" "as.guide/Fill"
@next "Float"

@toc "Pseudo Ops"

@{b}.fill REPEAT , SIZE , VALUE@{ub}
===========================

   RESULT, SIZE and VALUE are absolute expressions.  This emits REPEAT
copies of SIZE bytes.  REPEAT may be zero or more.  SIZE may be zero or
more, but if it is more than 8, then it is deemed to have the value 8,
compatible with other people's assemblers.  The contents of each REPEAT
bytes is taken from an 8-byte number.  The highest order 4 bytes are
zero.  The lowest order 4 bytes are VALUE rendered in the byte-order of
an integer on the computer @{b}as@{ub} is assembling for.  Each SIZE bytes in a
repetition is taken from the lowest order SIZE bytes of this number.
Again, this bizarre behavior is compatible with other people's
assemblers.

   SIZE and VALUE are optional.  If the second comma and VALUE are
absent, VALUE is assumed zero.  If the first comma and following tokens
are absent, SIZE is assumed to be 1.

@{b}.float FLONUMS@{ub}
==============

   This directive assembles zero or more flonums, separated by commas.
It has the same effect as @{b}.single@{ub}.  The exact kind of floating point

@next "hword"
@prev "Float"
@toc "Pseudo Ops"

@{b}.global SYMBOL@{ub}, @{b}.globl SYMBOL@{ub}
=============================

@{b}   .global@{ub} makes the symbol visible to @{b}ld@{ub}.  If you define SYMBOL in
your partial program, its value is made available to other partial
programs that are linked with it.  Otherwise, SYMBOL takes its
attributes from a symbol of the same name from another file linked into
the same program.

   Both spellings (@{b}.globl@{ub} and @{b}.global@{ub}) are accepted, for compatibility
with other assemblers.

   On the HPPA, @{b}.global@{ub} is not always enough to make it accessible to
other partial programs.  You may need the HPPA-only @{b}.EXPORT@{ub} directive
as well.  See @{"HPPA Assembler Directives" link "HPPA Directives"}.

@{b}.hword EXPRESSIONS@{ub}
==================

   This expects zero or more EXPRESSIONS, and emits a 16 bit number for

   This directive is a synonym for @{b}.short@{ub}; depending on the target

@{b}.ident@{ub}

@{b}.if ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION@{ub}
=======================

@{b}   .if@{ub} marks the beginning of a section of code which is only
considered part of the source program being assembled if the argument
(which must be an ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION) is non-zero.  The end of the
conditional section of code must be marked by @{b}.endif@{ub} (see @{".endif" link "Endif"});
optionally, you may include code for the alternative condition, flagged
by @{b}.else@{ub} (see @{".else" link "Else"}).

   The following variants of @{b}.if@{ub} are also supported:
@{b}.ifdef SYMBOL@{ub}
     Assembles the following section of code if the specified SYMBOL
     has been defined.

@{b}.ifndef SYMBOL@{ub}
@{b}.ifnotdef SYMBOL@{ub}
     Assembles the following section of code if the specified SYMBOL
     has not been defined.  Both spelling variants are equivalent.

@{b}.include "FILE"@{ub}
===============

   This directive provides a way to include supporting files at
specified points in your source program.  The code from FILE is
assembled as if it followed the point of the @{b}.include@{ub}; when the end of
the included file is reached, assembly of the original file continues.
You can control the search paths used with the @{b}-I@{ub} command-line option
(see @{"Command-Line Options" link "Invoking"}).  Quotation marks are required around FILE.

@{b}.int EXPRESSIONS@{ub}
================

   Expect zero or more EXPRESSIONS, of any section, separated by commas.
For each expression, emit a number that, at run time, is the value of
that expression.  The byte order and bit size of the number depends on
what kind of target the assembly is for.

@{b}.irp SYMBOL,VALUES@{ub}...
=====================

   Evaluate a sequence of statements assigning different values to
SYMBOL.  The sequence of statements starts at the @{b}.irp@{ub} directive, and is
terminated by an @{b}.endr@{ub} directive.  For each VALUE, SYMBOL is set to
VALUE, and the sequence of statements is assembled.  If no VALUE is
listed, the sequence of statements is assembled once, with SYMBOL set
to the null string.  To refer to SYMBOL within the sequence of
statements, use \\SYMBOL.

   For example, assembling

             .irp    param,1,2,3
             move    d\\param,sp@-
             .endr

   is equivalent to assembling

             move    d1,sp@-
             move    d2,sp@-
             move    d3,sp@-

@{b}.irpc SYMBOL,VALUES@{ub}...
======================

   Evaluate a sequence of statements assigning different values to
SYMBOL.  The sequence of statements starts at the @{b}.irpc@{ub} directive, and
is terminated by an @{b}.endr@{ub} directive.  For each character in VALUE,
SYMBOL is set to the character, and the sequence of statements is
assembled.  If no VALUE is listed, the sequence of statements is
assembled once, with SYMBOL set to the null string.  To refer to SYMBOL
within the sequence of statements, use \\SYMBOL.

   For example, assembling

             .irpc    param,123
             move    d\\param,sp@-
             .endr

   is equivalent to assembling

             move    d1,sp@-

@{b}.lcomm SYMBOL , LENGTH@{ub}
======================

   Reserve LENGTH (an absolute expression) bytes for a local common
denoted by SYMBOL.  The section and value of SYMBOL are those of the
new local common.  The addresses are allocated in the bss section, so
that at run-time the bytes start off zeroed.  SYMBOL is not declared
global (see @{".global" link "Global"}), so is normally not visible to @{b}ld@{ub}.

   Some targets permit a third argument to be used with @{b}.lcomm@{ub}.  This
argument specifies the desired alignment of the symbol in the bss
section.

   The syntax for @{b}.lcomm@{ub} differs slightly on the HPPA.  The syntax is
@{b}SYMBOL .lcomm, LENGTH@{ub}; SYMBOL is optional.

@toc "Pseudo Ops"

@{b}.line LINE-NUMBER@{ub}
=================

   Change the logical line number.  LINE-NUMBER must be an absolute
expression.  The next line has that logical line number.  Therefore any
other statements on the current line (after a statement separator
character) are reported as on logical line number LINE-NUMBER - 1.  One
day @{b}as@{ub} will no longer support this directive: it is recognized only for
compatibility with existing assembler programs.

@{i}   Warning:@{ui} In the AMD29K configuration of as, this command is not
available; use the synonym @{b}.ln@{ub} in that context.

   Even though this is a directive associated with the @{b}a.out@{ub} or @{b}b.out@{ub}
object-code formats, @{b}as@{ub} still recognizes it when producing COFF output,
and treats @{b}.line@{ub} as though it were the COFF @{b}.ln@{ub} @{i}if@{ui} it is found outside a
@{b}.def@{ub}/@{b}.endef@{ub} pair.

   Inside a @{b}.def@{ub}, @{b}.line@{ub} is, instead, one of the directives used by

@{b}.linkonce [TYPE]@{ub}
================

   Mark the current section so that the linker only includes a single
copy of it.  This may be used to include the same section in several
different object files, but ensure that the linker will only include it
once in the final output file.  The @{b}.linkonce@{ub} pseudo-op must be used
for each instance of the section.  Duplicate sections are detected
based on the section name, so it should be unique.

   This directive is only supported by a few object file formats; as of
this writing, the only object file format which supports it is the
Portable Executable format used on Windows NT.

   The TYPE argument is optional.  If specified, it must be one of the
following strings.  For example:
     .linkonce same_size
   Not all types may be supported on all object file formats.

@{b}discard@{ub}
     Silently discard duplicate sections.  This is the default.

@{b}one_only@{ub}
     Warn if there are duplicate sections, but still keep only one copy.

@{b}same_size@{ub}

@{b}.list@{ub}
=====

   Control (in conjunction with the @{b}.nolist@{ub} directive) whether or not
assembly listings are generated.  These two directives maintain an
internal counter (which is zero initially).   @{b}.list@{ub} increments the
counter, and @{b}.nolist@{ub} decrements it.  Assembly listings are generated
whenever the counter is greater than zero.

   By default, listings are disabled.  When you enable them (with the

@toc "Pseudo Ops"

@{b}.macro@{ub}
======

   The commands @{b}.macro@{ub} and @{b}.endm@{ub} allow you to define macros that
generate assembly output.  For example, this definition specifies a
macro @{b}sum@{ub} that puts a sequence of numbers into memory:

             .macro  sum from=0, to=5
             .long   \\from
             .if     \\to-\\from
             sum     "(\\from+1)",\\to
             .endif
             .endm

With that definition, @{b}SUM 0,5@{ub} is equivalent to this assembly input:

             .long   0
             .long   1
             .long   2
             .long   3
             .long   4
             .long   5

@{b}.macro MACNAME@{ub}
@{b}.macro MACNAME MACARGS ...@{ub}
     Begin the definition of a macro called MACNAME.  If your macro
     definition requires arguments, specify their names after the macro
     name, separated by commas or spaces.  You can supply a default
     value for any macro argument by following the name with @{b}=DEFLT@{ub}.
     For example, these are all valid @{b}.macro@{ub} statements:

    @{b}.macro comm@{ub}
          Begin the definition of a macro called @{b}comm@{ub}, which takes no
          arguments.

    @{b}.macro plus1 p, p1@{ub}
    @{b}.macro plus1 p p1@{ub}
          Either statement begins the definition of a macro called
          @{b}plus1@{ub}, which takes two arguments; within the macro
          definition, write @{b}\\p@{ub} or @{b}\\p1@{ub} to evaluate the arguments.

    @{b}.macro reserve_str p1=0 p2@{ub}
          Begin the definition of a macro called @{b}reserve_str@{ub}, with two
          arguments.  The first argument has a default value, but not
          the second.  After the definition is complete, you can call
          the macro either as @{b}reserve_str A,B@{ub} (with @{b}\\p1@{ub} evaluating to
          A and @{b}\\p2@{ub} evaluating to B), or as @{b}reserve_str ,B@{ub} (with @{b}\\p1@{ub}
          evaluating as the default, in this case @{b}0@{ub}, and @{b}\\p2@{ub}
          evaluating to B).

     When you call a macro, you can specify the argument values either
     by position, or by keyword.  For example, @{b}sum 9,17@{ub} is equivalent to
     @{b}sum to=17, from=9@{ub}.

@{b}.endm@{ub}
     Mark the end of a macro definition.

@{b}.exitm@{ub}
     Exit early from the current macro definition.

@{b}\\@@{ub}
@{b}     as@{ub} maintains a counter of how many macros it has executed in this
     pseudo-variable; you can copy that number to your output with @{b}\\@@{ub},
     but @{i}only within a macro definition@{ui}.

@{b}.octa BIGNUMS@{ub}
=============

   This directive expects zero or more bignums, separated by commas.
For each bignum, it emits a 16-byte integer.

   The term "octa" comes from contexts in which a "word" is two bytes;
hence @{i}octa@{ui}-word for 16 bytes.

@{b}.org NEW-LC , FILL@{ub}
==================

   Advance the location counter of the current section to NEW-LC.
NEW-LC is either an absolute expression or an expression with the same
section as the current subsection.  That is, you can't use @{b}.org@{ub} to
cross sections: if NEW-LC has the wrong section, the @{b}.org@{ub} directive is
ignored.  To be compatible with former assemblers, if the section of
NEW-LC is absolute, @{b}as@{ub} issues a warning, then pretends the section of
NEW-LC is the same as the current subsection.

@{b}   .org@{ub} may only increase the location counter, or leave it unchanged;
you cannot use @{b}.org@{ub} to move the location counter backwards.

   Because @{b}as@{ub} tries to assemble programs in one pass, NEW-LC may not be
undefined.  If you really detest this restriction we eagerly await a
chance to share your improved assembler.

   Beware that the origin is relative to the start of the section, not
to the start of the subsection.  This is compatible with other people's
assemblers.

   When the location counter (of the current subsection) is advanced,
the intervening bytes are filled with FILL which should be an absolute
expression.  If the comma and FILL are omitted, FILL defaults to zero.


@endnode

@next "Psize"
@prev "Org"
@toc "Pseudo Ops"

@{b}.p2align[wl] ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR@{ub}
=========================================

   Pad the location counter (in the current subsection) to a particular
storage boundary.  The first expression (which must be absolute) is the
number of low-order zero bits the location counter must have after
advancement.  For example @{b}.p2align 3@{ub} advances the location counter
until it a multiple of 8.  If the location counter is already a
multiple of 8, no change is needed.

   The second expression (also absolute) gives the fill value to be
stored in the padding bytes.  It (and the comma) may be omitted.  If it
is omitted, the padding bytes are normally zero.  However, on some
systems, if the section is marked as containing code and the fill value
is omitted, the space is filled with no-op instructions.

   The third expression is also absolute, and is also optional.  If it
is present, it is the maximum number of bytes that should be skipped by
this alignment directive.  If doing the alignment would require
skipping more bytes than the specified maximum, then the alignment is
not done at all.  You can omit the fill value (the second argument)
entirely by simply using two commas after the required alignment; this
can be useful if you want the alignment to be filled with no-op
instructions when appropriate.

   The @{b}.p2alignw@{ub} and @{b}.p2alignl@{ub} directives are variants of the @{b}.p2align@{ub}
directive.  The @{b}.p2alignw@{ub} directive treats the fill pattern as a two
byte word value.  The @{b}.p2alignl@{ub} directives treats the fill pattern as a
four byte longword value.  For example, @{b}.p2alignw 2,0x368d@{ub} will align
to a multiple of 4.  If it skips two bytes, they will be filled in with
the value 0x368d (the exact placement of the bytes depends upon the
endianness of the processor).  If it skips 1 or 3 bytes, the fill value
is undefined.

   If you do not use @{b}.psize@{ub}, listings use a default line-count of 60.
You may omit the comma and COLUMNS specification; the default width is
200 columns.

@{b}   as@{ub} generates formfeeds whenever the specified number of lines is

bytes, it prints a warning message; and just takes the lowest order 8
bytes of the bignum.

   The term "quad" comes from contexts in which a "word" is two bytes;

   For COFF targets, the @{b}.section@{ub} directive is used in one of the
following ways:
     .section NAME[, "FLAGS"]
     .section NAME[, SUBSEGMENT]

   If the optional argument is quoted, it is taken as flags to use for
the section.  Each flag is a single character.  The following flags are
recognized:
@{b}b@{ub}
     bss section (uninitialized data)

@{b}n@{ub}
     section is not loaded

@{b}w@{ub}
     writable section

@{b}d@{ub}
     data section

@{b}r@{ub}
     read-only section

@{b}x@{ub}
     executable section

   If no flags are specified, the default flags depend upon the section
name.  If the section name is not recognized, the default will be for
the section to be loaded and writable.

   If the optional argument to the @{b}.section@{ub} directive is not quoted, it
is taken as a subsegment number (see @{"Sub-Sections" link "Sub-Sections"}).

   For ELF targets, the @{b}.section@{ub} directive is used like this:
     .section NAME[, "FLAGS"[, \@TYPE]]
   The optional FLAGS argument is a quoted string which may contain any
combintion of the following characters:
@{b}a@{ub}
     section is allocatable

@{b}w@{ub}
     section is writable

@{b}x@{ub}
     section is executable

   The optional TYPE argument may contain one of the following
constants:
@{b}@progbits@{ub}
     section contains data

@{b}@nobits@{ub}
     section does not contain data (i.e., section only occupies space)

   If no flags are specified, the default flags depend upon the section
name.  If the section name is not recognized, the default will be for
the section to have none of the above flags: it will not be allocated
in memory, nor writable, nor executable.  The section will contain data.

   For ELF targets, the assembler supports another type of @{b}.section@{ub}
directive for compatibility with the Solaris assembler:
     .section "NAME"[, FLAGS...]
   Note that the section name is quoted.  There may be a sequence of
comma separated flags:
@{b}#alloc@{ub}
     section is allocatable

@{b}#write@{ub}
     section is writable

@{b}#execinstr@{ub}
     section is executable

@{b}.stabd, .stabn, .stabs@{ub}
======================

   There are three directives that begin @{b}.stab@{ub}.  All emit symbols (see
@{"Symbols" link "Symbols"}), for use by symbolic debuggers.  The symbols are not entered
in the @{b}as@{ub} hash table: they cannot be referenced elsewhere in the source
file.  Up to five fields are required:

STRING
     This is the symbol's name.  It may contain any character except
     @{b}\\000@{ub}, so is more general than ordinary symbol names.  Some
     debuggers used to code arbitrarily complex structures into symbol
     names using this field.

TYPE
     An absolute expression.  The symbol's type is set to the low 8
     bits of this expression.  Any bit pattern is permitted, but @{b}ld@{ub} and
     debuggers choke on silly bit patterns.

OTHER
     An absolute expression.  The symbol's "other" attribute is set to
     the low 8 bits of this expression.

DESC
     An absolute expression.  The symbol's descriptor is set to the low
     16 bits of this expression.

VALUE
     An absolute expression which becomes the symbol's value.

   If a warning is detected while reading a @{b}.stabd@{ub}, @{b}.stabn@{ub}, or @{b}.stabs@{ub}
statement, the symbol has probably already been created; you get a
half-formed symbol in your object file.  This is compatible with
earlier assemblers!

@{b}.stabd TYPE , OTHER , DESC@{ub}
     The "name" of the symbol generated is not even an empty string.
     It is a null pointer, for compatibility.  Older assemblers used a
     null pointer so they didn't waste space in object files with empty
     strings.

     The symbol's value is set to the location counter, relocatably.
     When your program is linked, the value of this symbol is the
     address of the location counter when the @{b}.stabd@{ub} was assembled.

@{b}.stabn TYPE , OTHER , DESC , VALUE@{ub}
     The name of the symbol is set to the empty string @{b}""@{ub}.

@{b}.stabs STRING ,  TYPE , OTHER , DESC , VALUE@{ub}
     All five fields are specified.

@node "String" "as.guide/String"

@{b}.string@{ub} "STR"
=============

   Copy the characters in STR to the object file.  You may specify more
than one string to copy, separated by commas.  Unless otherwise
specified for a particular machine, the assembler marks the end of each
string with a 0 byte.  You can use any of the escape sequences
described in @{"Strings" link "Strings"}.

@node "Symver" "as.guide/Symver"
@next "Tag"

@toc "Pseudo Ops"

@{b}.symver@{ub}
=======

   Use the @{b}.symver@{ub} directive to bind symbols to specific version nodes
within a source file.  This is only supported on ELF platforms, and is
typically used when assembling files to be linked into a shared library.
There are cases where it may make sense to use this in objects to be
bound into an application itself so as to override a versioned symbol
from a shared library.

   For ELF targets, the @{b}.symver@{ub} directive is used like this:
     .symver NAME, NAME2@NODENAME
   In this case, the symbol NAME must exist and be defined within the
file being assembled.  The @{b}.versym@{ub} directive effectively creates a
symbol alias with the name NAME2@NODENAME, and in fact the main reason
that we just don't try and create a regular alias is that the \@
character isn't permitted in symbol names.  The NAME2 part of the name
is the actual name of the symbol by which it will be externally
referenced.  The name NAME itself is merely a name of convenience that
is used so that it is possible to have definitions for multiple
versions of a function within a single source file, and so that the
compiler can unambiguously know which version of a function is being
mentioned.  The NODENAME portion of the alias should be the name of a
node specified in the version script supplied to the linker when
building a shared library.  If you are attempting to override a
versioned symbol from a shared library, then NODENAME should correspond
to the nodename of the symbol you are trying to override.

symbol table with instances of those structures.

@{b}   .tag@{ub} is only used when generating COFF format output; when @{b}as@{ub} is

@{b}.word EXPRESSIONS@{ub}
=================

   This directive expects zero or more EXPRESSIONS, of any section,
separated by commas.

   The size of the number emitted, and its byte order, depend on what
target computer the assembly is for.

@{i}     Warning: Special Treatment to support Compilers@{ui}

   Machines with a 32-bit address space, but that do less than 32-bit
addressing, require the following special treatment.  If the machine of
interest to you does 32-bit addressing (or doesn't require it; see
@{"Machine Dependencies" link "Machine Dependencies"}), you can ignore this issue.

   In order to assemble compiler output into something that works, @{b}as@{ub}
occasionlly does strange things to @{b}.word@{ub} directives.  Directives of the
form @{b}.word sym1-sym2@{ub} are often emitted by compilers as part of jump
tables.  Therefore, when @{b}as@{ub} assembles a directive of the form @{b}.word
sym1-sym2@{ub}, and the difference between @{b}sym1@{ub} and @{b}sym2@{ub} does not fit in 16
bits, @{b}as@{ub} creates a @{i}secondary jump table@{ui}, immediately before the next
label.  This secondary jump table is preceded by a short-jump to the
first byte after the secondary table.  This short-jump prevents the flow
of control from accidentally falling into the new table.  Inside the
table is a long-jump to @{b}sym2@{ub}.  The original @{b}.word@{ub} contains @{b}sym1@{ub} minus
the address of the long-jump to @{b}sym2@{ub}.

   If there were several occurrences of @{b}.word sym1-sym2@{ub} before the
secondary jump table, all of them are adjusted.  If there was a @{b}.word
sym3-sym4@{ub}, that also did not fit in sixteen bits, a long-jump to @{b}sym4@{ub}
is included in the secondary jump table, and the @{b}.word@{ub} directives are
adjusted to contain @{b}sym3@{ub} minus the address of the long-jump to @{b}sym4@{ub};
and so on, for as many entries in the original jump table as necessary.

Machine Dependent Features
**************************

   The machine instruction sets are (almost by definition) different on
each machine where @{b}as@{ub} runs.  Floating point representations vary as
well, and @{b}as@{ub} often supports a few additional directives or command-line
options for compatibility with other assemblers on a particular
platform.  Finally, some versions of @{b}as@{ub} support special
pseudo-instructions for branch optimization.

   This chapter discusses most of these differences, though it does not
include details on any machine's instruction set.  For details on that
subject, see the hardware manufacturer's manual.

leading zeros.  The leading letters may be in either upper or lower
case; for example, @{b}gr13@{ub} and @{b}LR7@{ub} are both valid register names.

   You may also refer to general-purpose registers by specifying the
register number as the result of an expression (prefixed with @{b}%%@{ub} to
flag the expression as a register number):
     %%EXPRESSION

--where EXPRESSION must be an absolute expression evaluating to a
number between @{b}0@{ub} and @{b}255@{ub}.  The range [0, 127] refers to global
registers, and the range [128, 255] to local registers.

Size Modifiers
..............

   The D10V version of @{b}as@{ub} uses the instruction names in the D10V
Architecture Manual.  However, the names in the manual are sometimes
ambiguous.  There are instruction names that can assemble to a short or
long form opcode.  How does the assembler pick the correct form?  @{b}as@{ub}
will always pick the smallest form if it can.  When dealing with a
symbol that is not defined yet when a line is being assembled, it will
always use the long form.  If you need to force the assembler to use
either the short or long form of the instruction, you can append either
@{b}.s@{ub} (short) or @{b}.l@{ub} (long) to it.  For example, if you are writing an
assembly program and you want to do a branch to a symbol that is
defined later in your program, you can write @{b}bra.s   foo@{ub}.  Objdump and
GDB will always append @{b}.s@{ub} or @{b}.l@{ub} to instructions which have both short
and long forms.

Sub-Instructions
................

   The D10V assembler takes as input a series of instructions, either
one-per-line, or in the special two-per-line format described in the
next section.  Some of these instructions will be short-form or
sub-instructions.  These sub-instructions can be packed into a single
instruction.  The assembler will do this automatically.  It will also
detect when it should not pack instructions.  For example, when a label
is defined, the next instruction will never be packaged with the
previous one.  Whenever a branch and link instruction is called, it
will not be packaged with the next instruction so the return address
will be valid.  Nops are automatically inserted when necessary.

   If you do not want the assembler automatically making these
decisions, you can control the packaging and execution type (parallel
or sequential) with the special execution symbols described in the next
section.

Special Characters
..................

@{b}   ;@{ub} and @{b}#@{ub} are the line comment characters.  Sub-instructions may be
executed in order, in reverse-order, or in parallel.  Instructions
listed in the standard one-per-line format will be executed
sequentially.  To specify the executing order, use the following
symbols:
@{b}->@{ub}
     Sequential with instruction on the left first.

@{b}<-@{ub}
     Sequential with instruction on the right first.

@{b}||@{ub}
     Parallel The D10V syntax allows either one instruction per line,
one instruction per line with the execution symbol, or two instructions
per line.  For example
@{b}abs       a1      ->      abs     r0@{ub}
     Execute these sequentially.  The instruction on the right is in
     the right container and is executed second.

@{b}abs       r0      <-      abs     a1@{ub}
     Execute these reverse-sequentially.  The instruction on the right
     is in the right container, and is executed first.

@{b}ld2w    r2,@r8+         ||      mac     a0,r0,r7@{ub}
     Execute these in parallel.

@{b}ld2w    r2,@r8+         ||@{ub}
@{b}mac     a0,r0,r7@{ub}
     Two-line format. Execute these in parallel.

@{b}ld2w    r2,@r8+@{ub}
@{b}mac     a0,r0,r7@{ub}
     Two-line format. Execute these sequentially.  Assembler will put
     them in the proper containers.

@{b}ld2w    r2,@r8+         ->@{ub}
@{b}mac     a0,r0,r7@{ub}
     Two-line format. Execute these sequentially.  Same as above but
     second instruction will always go into right container.  Since @{b}$@{ub}
has no special meaning, you may use it in symbol names.

Register Names
..............

   You can use the predefined symbols @{b}r0@{ub} through @{b}r15@{ub} to refer to the
D10V registers.  You can also use @{b}sp@{ub} as an alias for @{b}r15@{ub}.  The
accumulators are @{b}a0@{ub} and @{b}a1@{ub}.  There are special register-pair names that
may optionally be used in opcodes that require even-numbered registers.
Register names are not case sensitive.

   Register Pairs
@{b}r0-r1@{ub}

@{b}r2-r3@{ub}

@{b}r4-r5@{ub}

@{b}r6-r7@{ub}

@{b}r8-r9@{ub}

@{b}r10-r11@{ub}

@{b}r12-r13@{ub}

@{b}r14-r15@{ub}
   The D10V also has predefined symbols for these control registers and
status bits:
@{b}psw@{ub}
     Processor Status Word

@{b}bpsw@{ub}
     Backup Processor Status Word

@{b}pc@{ub}
     Program Counter

@{b}bpc@{ub}
     Backup Program Counter

@{b}rpt_c@{ub}
     Repeat Count

@{b}rpt_s@{ub}
     Repeat Start address

@{b}rpt_e@{ub}
     Repeat End address

@{b}mod_s@{ub}
     Modulo Start address

@{b}mod_e@{ub}
     Modulo End address

@{b}iba@{ub}
     Instruction Break Address

@{b}f0@{ub}
     Flag 0

@{b}f1@{ub}
     Flag 1

@{b}c@{ub}

     Register indirect

@{b}@RN+@{ub}
     Register indirect with post-increment

@{b}@RN-@{ub}
     Register indirect with post-decrement

@{b}@-SP@{ub}
     Register indirect with pre-decrement

@{b}@(DISP, RN)@{ub}
     Register indirect with displacement

@{b}ADDR@{ub}
     PC relative address (for branch or rep).

@{b}#IMM@{ub}
     Immediate data (the @{b}#@{ub} is optional and ignored)

@WORD Modifier
..............

   Any symbol followed by @{b}\@word@{ub} will be replaced by the symbol's value
shifted right by 2.  This is used in situations such as loading a
register with the address of a function (or any other code fragment).
For example, if you want to load a register with the location of the
function @{b}main@{ub} then jump to that function, you could do it as follws:
     ldi     r2, main@word
     jmp     r2

@{b}   ;@{ub} is the line comment character.

Register Names
..............

   You can use predefined symbols of the form @{b}rNh@{ub} and @{b}rNl@{ub} to refer to
the H8/300 registers as sixteen 8-bit general-purpose registers.  N is
a digit from @{b}0@{ub} to @{b}7@{ub}); for instance, both @{b}r0h@{ub} and @{b}r7l@{ub} are valid register
names.

   You can also use the eight predefined symbols @{b}rN@{ub} to refer to the
H8/300 registers as 16-bit registers (you must use this form for
addressing).

   On the H8/300H, you can also use the eight predefined symbols @{b}erN@{ub}
(@{b}er0@{ub} ... @{b}er7@{ub}) to refer to the 32-bit general purpose registers.

   The two control registers are called @{b}pc@{ub} (program counter; a 16-bit
register, except on the H8/300H where it is 24 bits) and @{b}ccr@{ub} (condition
code register; an 8-bit register).  @{b}r7@{ub} is used as the stack pointer,
and can also be called @{b}sp@{ub}.

Addressing Modes
................

   as understands the following addressing modes for the H8/300:
@{b}rN@{ub}
     Register direct

@{b}@rN@{ub}
     Register indirect

@{b}@(D, rN)@{ub}
@{b}@(D:16, rN)@{ub}
@{b}@(D:24, rN)@{ub}
     Register indirect: 16-bit or 24-bit displacement D from register
     N.  (24-bit displacements are only meaningful on the H8/300H.)

@{b}@rN+@{ub}
     Register indirect with post-increment

@{b}@-rN@{ub}
     Register indirect with pre-decrement

@{b}@{b}@@{ub}AA@{ub}
@{b}@{b}@@{ub}AA:8@{ub}
@{b}@{b}@@{ub}AA:16@{ub}
@{b}@{b}@@{ub}AA:24@{ub}
     Absolute address @{b}aa@{ub}.  (The address size @{b}:24@{ub} only makes sense on
     the H8/300H.)

@{b}#XX@{ub}
@{b}#XX:8@{ub}
@{b}#XX:16@{ub}
@{b}#XX:32@{ub}
     Immediate data XX.  You may specify the @{b}:8@{ub}, @{b}:16@{ub}, or @{b}:32@{ub} for
     clarity, if you wish; but @{b}as@{ub} neither requires this nor uses
     it--the data size required is taken from context.

@{b}@{b}@@{ub}@{b}@@{ub}AA@{ub}
@{b}@{b}@@{ub}@{b}@@{ub}AA:8@{ub}
     Memory indirect.  You may specify the @{b}:8@{ub} for clarity, if you wish;
     but @{b}as@{ub} neither requires this nor uses it.

     usual (16-bit) for the H8/300 family.

   Four H8/300 instructions (@{b}add@{ub}, @{b}cmp@{ub}, @{b}mov@{ub}, @{b}sub@{ub}) are defined with
variants using the suffixes @{b}.b@{ub}, @{b}.w@{ub}, and @{b}.l@{ub} to specify the size of a
memory operand.  @{b}as@{ub} supports these suffixes, but does not require them;
since one of the operands is always a register, @{b}as@{ub} can deduce the
correct size.

   For example, since @{b}r0@{ub} refers to a 16-bit register,
     mov    r0,@foo
is equivalent to
     mov.w  r0,@foo

   If you use the size suffixes, @{b}as@{ub} issues a warning when the suffix
and the register size do not match.

Special Characters
..................

@{b}   !@{ub} is the line comment character.

@{b}   ;@{ub} can be used instead of a newline to separate statements.

   Since @{b}$@{ub} has no special meaning, you may use it in symbol names.

Register Names
..............

   You can use the predefined symbols @{b}r0@{ub}, @{b}r1@{ub}, @{b}r2@{ub}, @{b}r3@{ub}, @{b}r4@{ub}, @{b}r5@{ub}, @{b}r6@{ub}, and
@{b}r7@{ub} to refer to the H8/500 registers.

   The H8/500 also has these control registers:

@{b}cp@{ub}
     code pointer

@{b}dp@{ub}
     data pointer

@{b}bp@{ub}
     base pointer

@{b}tp@{ub}
     stack top pointer

@{b}ep@{ub}
     extra pointer

@{b}sr@{ub}
     status register

@{b}ccr@{ub}
     condition code register

   All registers are 16 bits long.  To represent 32 bit numbers, use two
adjacent registers; for distant memory addresses, use one of the segment
pointers (@{b}cp@{ub} for the program counter; @{b}dp@{ub} for @{b}r0@{ub}-@{b}r3@{ub}; @{b}ep@{ub} for @{b}r4@{ub} and @{b}r5@{ub};
and @{b}tp@{ub} for @{b}r6@{ub} and @{b}r7@{ub}.

@{b}RN@{ub}
     Register direct

@{b}@RN@{ub}
     Register indirect

@{b}@(d:8, RN)@{ub}
     Register indirect with 8 bit signed displacement

@{b}@(d:16, RN)@{ub}
     Register indirect with 16 bit signed displacement

@{b}@-RN@{ub}
     Register indirect with pre-decrement

@{b}@RN+@{ub}
     Register indirect with post-increment

@{b}@AA:8@{ub}
     8 bit absolute address

@{b}@AA:16@{ub}
     16 bit absolute address

@{b}#XX:8@{ub}
     8 bit immediate

@{b}#XX:16@{ub}
     16 bit immediate

Notes
-----

   As a back end for GNU CC @{b}as@{ub} has been throughly tested and should
work extremely well.  We have tested it only minimally on hand written
assembly code and no one has tested it much on the assembly output from
the HP compilers.

   The format of the debugging sections has changed since the original
@{b}as@{ub} port (version 1.3X) was released; therefore, you must rebuild all
HPPA objects and libraries with the new assembler so that you can debug
the final executable.

   The HPPA @{b}as@{ub} port generates a small subset of the relocations
available in the SOM and ELF object file formats.  Additional relocation
support will be added as it becomes necessary.

Syntax
------

   The assembler syntax closely follows the HPPA instruction set
reference manual; assembler directives and general syntax closely
follow the HPPA assembly language reference manual, with a few
noteworthy differences.

   First, a colon may immediately follow a label definition.  This is
simply for compatibility with how most assembly language programmers
write code.

   Some obscure expression parsing problems may affect hand written
code which uses the @{b}spop@{ub} instructions, or code which makes significant
use of the @{b}!@{ub} line separator.

@{b}   as@{ub} is much less forgiving about missing arguments and other similar
oversights than the HP assembler.  @{b}as@{ub} notifies you of missing arguments
as syntax errors; this is regarded as a feature, not a bug.

   Finally, @{b}as@{ub} allows you to use an external symbol without explicitly
importing the symbol.  @{i}Warning:@{ui} in the future this will be an error for
HPPA targets.

   Special characters for HPPA targets include:

@{b}   ;@{ub} is the line comment character.

@{b}   !@{ub} can be used instead of a newline to separate statements.

   Since @{b}$@{ub} has no special meaning, you may use it in symbol names.

HPPA Assembler Directives
-------------------------

@{b}   as@{ub} for the HPPA supports many additional directives for
compatibility with the native assembler.  This section describes them
only briefly.  For detailed information on HPPA-specific assembler
directives, see `HP9000 Series 800 Assembly Language Reference Manual'
(HP 92432-90001).

@{b}   as@{ub} does @{i}not@{ui} support the following assembler directives described in
the HP manual:

     .endm           .liston
     .enter          .locct
     .leave          .macro
     .listoff

   Beyond those implemented for compatibility, @{b}as@{ub} supports one
additional assembler directive for the HPPA: @{b}.param@{ub}.  It conveys
register argument locations for static functions.  Its syntax closely
follows the @{b}.export@{ub} directive.

   These are the additional directives in @{b}as@{ub} for the HPPA:

@{b}.block N@{ub}
@{b}.blockz N@{ub}
     Reserve N bytes of storage, and initialize them to zero.

@{b}.call@{ub}
     Mark the beginning of a procedure call.  Only the special case
     with @{i}no arguments@{ui} is allowed.

@{b}.callinfo [ PARAM=VALUE, ... ]  [ FLAG, ... ]@{ub}
     Specify a number of parameters and flags that define the
     environment for a procedure.

     PARAM may be any of @{b}frame@{ub} (frame size), @{b}entry_gr@{ub} (end of general
     register range), @{b}entry_fr@{ub} (end of float register range), @{b}entry_sr@{ub}
     (end of space register range).

     The values for FLAG are @{b}calls@{ub} or @{b}caller@{ub} (proc has subroutines),
     @{b}no_calls@{ub} (proc does not call subroutines), @{b}save_rp@{ub} (preserve
     return pointer), @{b}save_sp@{ub} (proc preserves stack pointer), @{b}no_unwind@{ub}
     (do not unwind this proc), @{b}hpux_int@{ub} (proc is interrupt routine).

@{b}.code@{ub}
     Assemble into the standard section called @{b}$TEXT$@{ub}, subsection
     @{b}$CODE$@{ub}.

@{b}.copyright "STRING"@{ub}
     In the SOM object format, insert STRING into the object code,
     marked as a copyright string.

@{b}.copyright "STRING"@{ub}
     In the ELF object format, insert STRING into the object code,
     marked as a version string.

@{b}.enter@{ub}
     Not yet supported; the assembler rejects programs containing this
     directive.

@{b}.entry@{ub}
     Mark the beginning of a procedure.

@{b}.exit@{ub}
     Mark the end of a procedure.

@{b}.export NAME [ ,TYP ]  [ ,PARAM=R ]@{ub}
     Make a procedure NAME available to callers.  TYP, if present, must
     be one of @{b}absolute@{ub}, @{b}code@{ub} (ELF only, not SOM), @{b}data@{ub}, @{b}entry@{ub}, @{b}data@{ub},
     @{b}entry@{ub}, @{b}millicode@{ub}, @{b}plabel@{ub}, @{b}pri_prog@{ub}, or @{b}sec_prog@{ub}.

     PARAM, if present, provides either relocation information for the
     procedure arguments and result, or a privilege level.  PARAM may be
     @{b}argwN@{ub} (where N ranges from @{b}0@{ub} to @{b}3@{ub}, and indicates one of four
     one-word arguments); @{b}rtnval@{ub} (the procedure's result); or @{b}priv_lev@{ub}
     (privilege level).  For arguments or the result, R specifies how
     to relocate, and must be one of @{b}no@{ub} (not relocatable), @{b}gr@{ub} (argument
     is in general register), @{b}fr@{ub} (in floating point register), or @{b}fu@{ub}
     (upper half of float register).  For @{b}priv_lev@{ub}, R is an integer.

@{b}.half N@{ub}
     Define a two-byte integer constant N; synonym for the portable @{b}as@{ub}
     directive @{b}.short@{ub}.

@{b}.import NAME [ ,TYP ]@{ub}
     Converse of @{b}.export@{ub}; make a procedure available to call.  The
     arguments use the same conventions as the first two arguments for
     @{b}.export@{ub}.

@{b}.label NAME@{ub}
     Define NAME as a label for the current assembly location.

@{b}.leave@{ub}
     Not yet supported; the assembler rejects programs containing this
     directive.

@{b}.origin LC@{ub}
     Advance location counter to LC. Synonym for the @{b}{No Value For "as"}@{ub}
     portable directive @{b}.org@{ub}.

@{b}.param NAME [ ,TYP ]  [ ,PARAM=R ]@{ub}
     Similar to @{b}.export@{ub}, but used for static procedures.

@{b}.proc@{ub}
     Use preceding the first statement of a procedure.

@{b}.procend@{ub}
     Use following the last statement of a procedure.

@{b}LABEL .reg EXPR@{ub}
     Synonym for @{b}.equ@{ub}; define LABEL with the absolute expression EXPR
     as its value.

@{b}.space SECNAME [ ,PARAMS ]@{ub}
     Switch to section SECNAME, creating a new section by that name if
     necessary.  You may only use PARAMS when creating a new section,
     not when switching to an existing one.  SECNAME may identify a
     section by number rather than by name.

     If specified, the list PARAMS declares attributes of the section,
     identified by keywords.  The keywords recognized are @{b}spnum=EXP@{ub}
     (identify this section by the number EXP, an absolute expression),
     @{b}sort=EXP@{ub} (order sections according to this sort key when linking;
     EXP is an absolute expression), @{b}unloadable@{ub} (section contains no
     loadable data), @{b}notdefined@{ub} (this section defined elsewhere), and
     @{b}private@{ub} (data in this section not available to other programs).

@{b}.spnum SECNAM@{ub}
     Allocate four bytes of storage, and initialize them with the
     section number of the section named SECNAM.  (You can define the
     section number with the HPPA @{b}.space@{ub} directive.)

@{b}.string "STR"@{ub}
     Copy the characters in the string STR to the object file.  See
     @{"Strings" link "Strings"}, for information on escape sequences you can use in @{b}as@{ub}
     strings.

@{i}     Warning!@{ui} The HPPA version of @{b}.string@{ub} differs from the usual @{b}as@{ub}
     definition: it does @{i}not@{ui} write a zero byte after copying STR.

@{b}.stringz "STR"@{ub}
     Like @{b}.string@{ub}, but appends a zero byte after copying STR to object
     file.

@{b}.subspa NAME [ ,PARAMS ]@{ub}

@{b}.nsubspa NAME [ ,PARAMS ]@{ub}
     Similar to @{b}.space@{ub}, but selects a subsection NAME within the
     current section.  You may only specify PARAMS when you create a
     subsection (in the first instance of @{b}.subspa@{ub} for this NAME).

     If specified, the list PARAMS declares attributes of the
     subsection, identified by keywords.  The keywords recognized are
     @{b}quad=EXPR@{ub} ("quadrant" for this subsection), @{b}align=EXPR@{ub} (alignment
     for beginning of this subsection; a power of two), @{b}access=EXPR@{ub}
     (value for "access rights" field), @{b}sort=EXPR@{ub} (sorting order for
     this subspace in link), @{b}code_only@{ub} (subsection contains only code),
     @{b}unloadable@{ub} (subsection cannot be loaded into memory), @{b}common@{ub}
     (subsection is common block), @{b}dup_comm@{ub} (initialized data may have
     duplicate names), or @{b}zero@{ub} (subsection is all zeros, do not write in
     object file).

@{b}     .nsubspa@{ub} always creates a new subspace with the given name, even
     if one with the same name already exists.

@{b}.version "STR"@{ub}
     Write STR as version identifier in object code.

AT&T Syntax versus Intel Syntax
-------------------------------

   In order to maintain compatibility with the output of @{b}gcc@{ub}, @{b}as@{ub}
supports AT&T System V/386 assembler syntax.  This is quite different
from Intel syntax.  We mention these differences because almost all
80386 documents used only Intel syntax.  Notable differences between
the two syntaxes are:

   * AT&T immediate operands are preceded by @{b}$@{ub}; Intel immediate
     operands are undelimited (Intel @{b}push 4@{ub} is AT&T @{b}pushl $4@{ub}).  AT&T
     register operands are preceded by @{b}%@{ub}; Intel register operands are
     undelimited.  AT&T absolute (as opposed to PC relative) jump/call
     operands are prefixed by @{b}*@{ub}; they are undelimited in Intel syntax.

   * AT&T and Intel syntax use the opposite order for source and
     destination operands.  Intel @{b}add eax, 4@{ub} is @{b}addl $4, %eax@{ub}.  The
     @{b}source, dest@{ub} convention is maintained for compatibility with
     previous Unix assemblers.

   * In AT&T syntax the size of memory operands is determined from the
     last character of the opcode name.  Opcode suffixes of @{b}b@{ub}, @{b}w@{ub}, and @{b}l@{ub}
     specify byte (8-bit), word (16-bit), and long (32-bit) memory
     references.  Intel syntax accomplishes this by prefixes memory
     operands (@{i}not@{ui} the opcodes themselves) with @{b}byte ptr@{ub}, @{b}word ptr@{ub}, and
     @{b}dword ptr@{ub}.  Thus, Intel @{b}mov al, byte ptr FOO@{ub} is @{b}movb FOO, %al@{ub} in
     AT&T syntax.

   * Immediate form long jumps and calls are @{b}lcall/ljmp $SECTION,
     $OFFSET@{ub} in AT&T syntax; the Intel syntax is @{b}call/jmp far
     SECTION:OFFSET@{ub}.  Also, the far return instruction is @{b}lret
     $STACK-ADJUST@{ub} in AT&T syntax; Intel syntax is @{b}ret far STACK-ADJUST@{ub}.

   * The AT&T assembler does not provide support for multiple section
     programs.  Unix style systems expect all programs to be single
     sections.

@next "i386-Regs"
@prev "i386-Syntax"
@toc "i386-Dependent"

Opcode Naming
-------------

   Opcode names are suffixed with one character modifiers which specify
the size of operands.  The letters @{b}b@{ub}, @{b}w@{ub}, and @{b}l@{ub} specify byte, word, and
long operands.  If no suffix is specified by an instruction and it
contains no memory operands then @{b}as@{ub} tries to fill in the missing suffix
based on the destination register operand (the last one by convention).
Thus, @{b}mov %ax, %bx@{ub} is equivalent to @{b}movw %ax, %bx@{ub}; also, @{b}mov $1, %bx@{ub}
is equivalent to @{b}movw $1, %bx@{ub}.  Note that this is incompatible with the
AT&T Unix assembler which assumes that a missing opcode suffix implies
long operand size.  (This incompatibility does not affect compiler
output since compilers always explicitly specify the opcode suffix.)

   Almost all opcodes have the same names in AT&T and Intel format.
There are a few exceptions.  The sign extend and zero extend
instructions need two sizes to specify them.  They need a size to
sign/zero extend @{i}from@{ui} and a size to zero extend @{i}to@{ui}.  This is
accomplished by using two opcode suffixes in AT&T syntax.  Base names
for sign extend and zero extend are @{b}movs...@{ub} and @{b}movz...@{ub} in AT&T syntax
(@{b}movsx@{ub} and @{b}movzx@{ub} in Intel syntax).  The opcode suffixes are tacked on
to this base name, the @{i}from@{ui} suffix before the @{i}to@{ui} suffix.  Thus, @{b}movsbl
%al, %edx@{ub} is AT&T syntax for "move sign extend @{i}from@{ui} %al @{i}to@{ui} %edx."
Possible suffixes, thus, are @{b}bl@{ub} (from byte to long), @{b}bw@{ub} (from byte to
word), and @{b}wl@{ub} (from word to long).

   The Intel-syntax conversion instructions

   * @{b}cbw@{ub} -- sign-extend byte in @{b}%al@{ub} to word in @{b}%ax@{ub},

   * @{b}cwde@{ub} -- sign-extend word in @{b}%ax@{ub} to long in @{b}%eax@{ub},

   * @{b}cwd@{ub} -- sign-extend word in @{b}%ax@{ub} to long in @{b}%dx:%ax@{ub},

   * @{b}cdq@{ub} -- sign-extend dword in @{b}%eax@{ub} to quad in @{b}%edx:%eax@{ub},

are called @{b}cbtw@{ub}, @{b}cwtl@{ub}, @{b}cwtd@{ub}, and @{b}cltd@{ub} in AT&T naming.  @{b}as@{ub} accepts
either naming for these instructions.

   Far call/jump instructions are @{b}lcall@{ub} and @{b}ljmp@{ub} in AT&T syntax, but
are @{b}call far@{ub} and @{b}jump far@{ub} in Intel convention.

Register Naming
---------------

   Register operands are always prefixes with @{b}%@{ub}.  The 80386 registers
consist of

   * the 8 32-bit registers @{b}%eax@{ub} (the accumulator), @{b}%ebx@{ub}, @{b}%ecx@{ub}, @{b}%edx@{ub},
     @{b}%edi@{ub}, @{b}%esi@{ub}, @{b}%ebp@{ub} (the frame pointer), and @{b}%esp@{ub} (the stack pointer).

   * the 8 16-bit low-ends of these: @{b}%ax@{ub}, @{b}%bx@{ub}, @{b}%cx@{ub}, @{b}%dx@{ub}, @{b}%di@{ub}, @{b}%si@{ub}, @{b}%bp@{ub},
     and @{b}%sp@{ub}.

   * the 8 8-bit registers: @{b}%ah@{ub}, @{b}%al@{ub}, @{b}%bh@{ub}, @{b}%bl@{ub}, @{b}%ch@{ub}, @{b}%cl@{ub}, @{b}%dh@{ub}, and @{b}%dl@{ub}
     (These are the high-bytes and low-bytes of @{b}%ax@{ub}, @{b}%bx@{ub}, @{b}%cx@{ub}, and @{b}%dx@{ub})

   * the 6 section registers @{b}%cs@{ub} (code section), @{b}%ds@{ub} (data section),
     @{b}%ss@{ub} (stack section), @{b}%es@{ub}, @{b}%fs@{ub}, and @{b}%gs@{ub}.

   * the 3 processor control registers @{b}%cr0@{ub}, @{b}%cr2@{ub}, and @{b}%cr3@{ub}.

   * the 6 debug registers @{b}%db0@{ub}, @{b}%db1@{ub}, @{b}%db2@{ub}, @{b}%db3@{ub}, @{b}%db6@{ub}, and @{b}%db7@{ub}.

   * the 2 test registers @{b}%tr6@{ub} and @{b}%tr7@{ub}.

   * the 8 floating point register stack @{b}%st@{ub} or equivalently @{b}%st(0)@{ub},
     @{b}%st(1)@{ub}, @{b}%st(2)@{ub}, @{b}%st(3)@{ub}, @{b}%st(4)@{ub}, @{b}%st(5)@{ub}, @{b}%st(6)@{ub}, and @{b}%st(7)@{ub}.

Opcode Prefixes
---------------

   Opcode prefixes are used to modify the following opcode.  They are
used to repeat string instructions, to provide section overrides, to
perform bus lock operations, and to give operand and address size
(16-bit operands are specified in an instruction by prefixing what would
normally be 32-bit operands with a "operand size" opcode prefix).
Opcode prefixes are usually given as single-line instructions with no
operands, and must directly precede the instruction they act upon.  For
example, the @{b}scas@{ub} (scan string) instruction is repeated with:
             repne
             scas

   Here is a list of opcode prefixes:

   * Section override prefixes @{b}cs@{ub}, @{b}ds@{ub}, @{b}ss@{ub}, @{b}es@{ub}, @{b}fs@{ub}, @{b}gs@{ub}.  These are
     automatically added by specifying using the SECTION:MEMORY-OPERAND
     form for memory references.

   * Operand/Address size prefixes @{b}data16@{ub} and @{b}addr16@{ub} change 32-bit
     operands/addresses into 16-bit operands/addresses.  Note that
     16-bit addressing modes (i.e. 8086 and 80286 addressing modes) are
     not supported (yet).

   * The bus lock prefix @{b}lock@{ub} inhibits interrupts during execution of
     the instruction it precedes.  (This is only valid with certain
     instructions; see a 80386 manual for details).

   * The wait for coprocessor prefix @{b}wait@{ub} waits for the coprocessor to
     complete the current instruction.  This should never be needed for
     the 80386/80387 combination.

   * The @{b}rep@{ub}, @{b}repe@{ub}, and @{b}repne@{ub} prefixes are added to string instructions
     to make them repeat @{b}%ecx@{ub} times.

Memory References
-----------------

   An Intel syntax indirect memory reference of the form

     SECTION:[BASE + INDEX*SCALE + DISP]

is translated into the AT&T syntax

     SECTION:DISP(BASE, INDEX, SCALE)

where BASE and INDEX are the optional 32-bit base and index registers,
DISP is the optional displacement, and SCALE, taking the values 1, 2,
4, and 8, multiplies INDEX to calculate the address of the operand.  If
no SCALE is specified, SCALE is taken to be 1.  SECTION specifies the
optional section register for the memory operand, and may override the
default section register (see a 80386 manual for section register
defaults). Note that section overrides in AT&T syntax @{i}must@{ui} have be
preceded by a @{b}%@{ub}.  If you specify a section override which coincides
with the default section register, @{b}as@{ub} does @{i}not@{ui} output any section
register override prefixes to assemble the given instruction.  Thus,
section overrides can be specified to emphasize which section register
is used for a given memory operand.

   Here are some examples of Intel and AT&T style memory references:

AT&T: @{b}-4(%ebp)@{ub}, Intel:  @{b}[ebp - 4]@{ub}
     BASE is @{b}%ebp@{ub}; DISP is @{b}-4@{ub}. SECTION is missing, and the default
     section is used (@{b}%ss@{ub} for addressing with @{b}%ebp@{ub} as the base
     register).  INDEX, SCALE are both missing.

AT&T: @{b}foo(,%eax,4)@{ub}, Intel: @{b}[foo + eax*4]@{ub}
     INDEX is @{b}%eax@{ub} (scaled by a SCALE 4); DISP is @{b}foo@{ub}.  All other
     fields are missing.  The section register here defaults to @{b}%ds@{ub}.

AT&T: @{b}foo(,1)@{ub}; Intel @{b}[foo]@{ub}
     This uses the value pointed to by @{b}foo@{ub} as a memory operand.  Note
     that BASE and INDEX are both missing, but there is only @{i}one@{ui} @{b},@{ub}.
     This is a syntactic exception.

AT&T: @{b}%gs:foo@{ub}; Intel @{b}gs:foo@{ub}
     This selects the contents of the variable @{b}foo@{ub} with section
     register SECTION being @{b}%gs@{ub}.

   Absolute (as opposed to PC relative) call and jump operands must be
prefixed with @{b}*@{ub}.  If no @{b}*@{ub} is specified, @{b}as@{ub} always chooses PC relative
addressing for jump/call labels.

   Any instruction that has a memory operand @{i}must@{ui} specify its size
(byte, word, or long) with an opcode suffix (@{b}b@{ub}, @{b}w@{ub}, or @{b}l@{ub}, respectively).

Handling of Jump Instructions
-----------------------------

   Jump instructions are always optimized to use the smallest possible
displacements.  This is accomplished by using byte (8-bit) displacement
jumps whenever the target is sufficiently close.  If a byte displacement
is insufficient a long (32-bit) displacement is used.  We do not support
word (16-bit) displacement jumps (i.e. prefixing the jump instruction
with the @{b}addr16@{ub} opcode prefix), since the 80386 insists upon masking
@{b}%eip@{ub} to 16 bits after the word displacement is added.

   Note that the @{b}jcxz@{ub}, @{b}jecxz@{ub}, @{b}loop@{ub}, @{b}loopz@{ub}, @{b}loope@{ub}, @{b}loopnz@{ub} and @{b}loopne@{ub}
instructions only come in byte displacements, so that if you use these
instructions (@{b}gcc@{ub} does not use them) you may get an error message (and
incorrect code).  The AT&T 80386 assembler tries to get around this
problem by expanding @{b}jcxz foo@{ub} to

              jcxz cx_zero
              jmp cx_nonzero
     cx_zero: jmp foo
     cx_nonzero:

Floating Point
--------------

   All 80387 floating point types except packed BCD are supported.
(BCD support may be added without much difficulty).  These data types
are 16-, 32-, and 64- bit integers, and single (32-bit), double
(64-bit), and extended (80-bit) precision floating point.  Each
supported type has an opcode suffix and a constructor associated with
it.  Opcode suffixes specify operand's data types.  Constructors build
these data types into memory.

   * Floating point constructors are @{b}.float@{ub} or @{b}.single@{ub}, @{b}.double@{ub}, and
     @{b}.tfloat@{ub} for 32-, 64-, and 80-bit formats.  These correspond to
     opcode suffixes @{b}s@{ub}, @{b}l@{ub}, and @{b}t@{ub}.  @{b}t@{ub} stands for temporary real, and
     that the 80387 only supports this format via the @{b}fldt@{ub} (load
     temporary real to stack top) and @{b}fstpt@{ub} (store temporary real and
     pop stack) instructions.

   * Integer constructors are @{b}.word@{ub}, @{b}.long@{ub} or @{b}.int@{ub}, and @{b}.quad@{ub} for the
     16-, 32-, and 64-bit integer formats.  The corresponding opcode
     suffixes are @{b}s@{ub} (single), @{b}l@{ub} (long), and @{b}q@{ub} (quad).  As with the
     temporary real format the 64-bit @{b}q@{ub} format is only present in the
     @{b}fildq@{ub} (load quad integer to stack top) and @{b}fistpq@{ub} (store quad
     integer and pop stack) instructions.

   Register to register operations do not require opcode suffixes, so
that @{b}fst %st, %st(1)@{ub} is equivalent to @{b}fstl %st, %st(1)@{ub}.

   Since the 80387 automatically synchronizes with the 80386 @{b}fwait@{ub}
instructions are almost never needed (this is not the case for the
80286/80287 and 8086/8087 combinations).  Therefore, @{b}as@{ub} suppresses the
@{b}fwait@{ub} instruction whenever it is implicitly selected by one of the
@{b}fn...@{ub} instructions.  For example, @{b}fsave@{ub} and @{b}fnsave@{ub} are treated
identically.  In general, all the @{b}fn...@{ub} instructions are made
equivalent to @{b}f...@{ub} instructions.  If @{b}fwait@{ub} is desired it must be
explicitly coded.

Writing 16-bit Code
-------------------

   While GAS normally writes only "pure" 32-bit i386 code, it has
limited support for writing code to run in real mode or in 16-bit
protected mode code segments.  To do this, insert a @{b}.code16@{ub} directive
before the assembly language instructions to be run in 16-bit mode.
You can switch GAS back to writing normal 32-bit code with the @{b}.code32@{ub}
directive.

   GAS understands exactly the same assembly language syntax in 16-bit
mode as in 32-bit mode.  The function of any given instruction is
exactly the same regardless of mode, as long as the resulting object
code is executed in the mode for which GAS wrote it.  So, for example,
the @{b}ret@{ub} mnemonic produces a 32-bit return instruction regardless of
whether it is to be run in 16-bit or 32-bit mode.  (If GAS is in 16-bit
mode, it will add an operand size prefix to the instruction to force it
to be a 32-bit return.)

   This means, for one thing, that you can use GNU CC to write code to
be run in real mode or 16-bit protected mode.  Just insert the statement
@{b}asm(".code16");@{ub} at the beginning of your C source file, and while GNU
CC will still be generating 32-bit code, GAS will automatically add all
the necessary size prefixes to make that code run in 16-bit mode.  Of
course, since GNU CC only writes small-model code (it doesn't know how
to attach segment selectors to pointers like native x86 compilers do),
any 16-bit code you write with GNU CC will essentially be limited to a
64K address space.  Also, there will be a code size and performance
penalty due to all the extra address and operand size prefixes GAS has
to add to the instructions.

   Note that placing GAS in 16-bit mode does not mean that the resulting
code will necessarily run on a 16-bit pre-80386 processor.  To write
code that runs on such a processor, you would have to refrain from using
@{i}any@{ui} 32-bit constructs which require GAS to output address or operand
size prefixes.  At the moment this would be rather difficult, because
GAS currently supports @{i}only@{ui} 32-bit addressing modes: when writing
16-bit code, it @{i}always@{ui} outputs address size prefixes for any
instruction that uses a non-register addressing mode.  So you can write
code that runs on 16-bit processors, but only if that code never
references memory.

Notes
-----

   There is some trickery concerning the @{b}mul@{ub} and @{b}imul@{ub} instructions that
deserves mention.  The 16-, 32-, and 64-bit expanding multiplies (base
opcode @{b}0xf6@{ub}; extension 4 for @{b}mul@{ub} and 5 for @{b}imul@{ub}) can be output only in
the one operand form.  Thus, @{b}imul %ebx, %eax@{ub} does @{i}not@{ui} select the
expanding multiply; the expanding multiply would clobber the @{b}%edx@{ub}
register, and this would confuse @{b}gcc@{ub} output.  Use @{b}imul %ebx@{ub} to get the
64-bit product in @{b}%edx:%eax@{ub}.

   We have added a two operand form of @{b}imul@{ub} when the first operand is
an immediate mode expression and the second operand is a register.
This is just a shorthand, so that, multiplying @{b}%eax@{ub} by 69, for example,
can be done with @{b}imul $69, %eax@{ub} rather than @{b}imul $69, %eax, %eax@{ub}.

@toc "i960-Dependent"

i960 Command-line Options
-------------------------

@{b}-ACA | -ACA_A | -ACB | -ACC | -AKA | -AKB | -AKC | -AMC@{ub}
     Select the 80960 architecture.  Instructions or features not
     supported by the selected architecture cause fatal errors.

@{b}     -ACA@{ub} is equivalent to @{b}-ACA_A@{ub}; @{b}-AKC@{ub} is equivalent to @{b}-AMC@{ub}.
     Synonyms are provided for compatibility with other tools.

     If you do not specify any of these options, @{b}as@{ub} generates code for
     any instruction or feature that is supported by @{i}some@{ui} version of the
     960 (even if this means mixing architectures!).  In principle, @{b}as@{ub}
     attempts to deduce the minimal sufficient processor type if none
     is specified; depending on the object code format, the processor
     type may be recorded in the object file.  If it is critical that
     the @{b}as@{ub} output match a specific architecture, specify that
     architecture explicitly.

@{b}-b@{ub}
     Add code to collect information about conditional branches taken,
     for later optimization using branch prediction bits.  (The
     conditional branch instructions have branch prediction bits in the
     CA, CB, and CC architectures.)  If BR represents a conditional
     branch instruction, the following represents the code generated by
     the assembler when @{b}-b@{ub} is specified:

                  call    INCREMENT ROUTINE
                  .word   0       # pre-counter
          Label:  BR
                  call    INCREMENT ROUTINE
                  .word   0       # post-counter

     The counter following a branch records the number of times that
     branch was @{i}not@{ui} taken; the differenc between the two counters is the
     number of times the branch @{i}was@{ui} taken.

     A table of every such @{b}Label@{ub} is also generated, so that the
     external postprocessor @{b}gbr960@{ub} (supplied by Intel) can locate all
     the counters.  This table is always labelled @{b}__BRANCH_TABLE__@{ub};
     this is a local symbol to permit collecting statistics for many
     separate object files.  The table is word aligned, and begins with
     a two-word header.  The first word, initialized to 0, is used in
     maintaining linked lists of branch tables.  The second word is a
     count of the number of entries in the table, which follow
     immediately: each is a word, pointing to one of the labels
     illustrated above.

           +------------+------------+------------+ ... +------------+
           |            |            |            |     |            |
           |  *NEXT     |  COUNT: N  | *BRLAB 1   |     | *BRLAB N   |
           |            |            |            |     |            |
           +------------+------------+------------+ ... +------------+
          
                         __BRANCH_TABLE__ layout

     The first word of the header is used to locate multiple branch
     tables, since each object file may contain one. Normally the links
     are maintained with a call to an initialization routine, placed at
     the beginning of each function in the file.  The GNU C compiler
     generates these calls automatically when you give it a @{b}-b@{ub} option.
     For further details, see the documentation of @{b}gbr960@{ub}.

@{b}-no-relax@{ub}
     Normally, Compare-and-Branch instructions with targets that require
     displacements greater than 13 bits (or that have external targets)
     are replaced with the corresponding compare (or @{b}chkbit@{ub}) and branch
     instructions.  You can use the @{b}-no-relax@{ub} option to specify that @{b}as@{ub}
     should generate errors instead, if the target displacement is
     larger than 13 bits.

     This option does not affect the Compare-and-Jump instructions; the
     code emitted for them is @{i}always@{ui} adjusted when necessary (depending
     on displacement size), regardless of whether you use @{b}-no-relax@{ub}.

i960 Machine Directives
-----------------------

@{b}.bss SYMBOL, LENGTH, ALIGN@{ub}
     Reserve LENGTH bytes in the bss section for a local SYMBOL,
     aligned to the power of two specified by ALIGN.  LENGTH and ALIGN
     must be positive absolute expressions.  This directive differs
     from @{b}.lcomm@{ub} only in that it permits you to specify an alignment.
     See @{".lcomm" link "Lcomm"}.

@{b}.extended FLONUMS@{ub}
@{b}     .extended@{ub} expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas; for
     each flonum, @{b}.extended@{ub} emits an IEEE extended-format (80-bit)
     floating-point number.

@{b}.leafproc CALL-LAB, BAL-LAB@{ub}
     You can use the @{b}.leafproc@{ub} directive in conjunction with the
     optimized @{b}callj@{ub} instruction to enable faster calls of leaf
     procedures.  If a procedure is known to call no other procedures,
     you may define an entry point that skips procedure prolog code
     (and that does not depend on system-supplied saved context), and
     declare it as the BAL-LAB using @{b}.leafproc@{ub}.  If the procedure also
     has an entry point that goes through the normal prolog, you can
     specify that entry point as CALL-LAB.

     A @{b}.leafproc@{ub} declaration is meant for use in conjunction with the
     optimized call instruction @{b}callj@{ub}; the directive records the data
     needed later to choose between converting the @{b}callj@{ub} into a @{b}bal@{ub} or
     a @{b}call@{ub}.

     CALL-LAB is optional; if only one argument is present, or if the
     two arguments are identical, the single argument is assumed to be
     the @{b}bal@{ub} entry point.

@{b}.sysproc NAME, INDEX@{ub}
     The @{b}.sysproc@{ub} directive defines a name for a system procedure.
     After you define it using @{b}.sysproc@{ub}, you can use NAME to refer to
     the system procedure identified by INDEX when calling procedures
     with the optimized call instruction @{b}callj@{ub}.

     Both arguments are required; INDEX must be between 0 and 31
     (inclusive).

   All Intel 960 machine instructions are supported; see

instruction subset for a particular 960 architecture.

   Some opcodes are processed beyond simply emitting a single
corresponding instruction: @{b}callj@{ub}, and Compare-and-Branch or
Compare-and-Jump instructions with target displacements larger than 13
bits.

   You can write @{b}callj@{ub} to have the assembler or the linker determine
the most appropriate form of subroutine call: @{b}call@{ub}, @{b}bal@{ub}, or @{b}calls@{ub}.  If
the assembly source contains enough information--a @{b}.leafproc@{ub} or
@{b}.sysproc@{ub} directive defining the operand--then @{b}as@{ub} translates the @{b}callj@{ub};
if not, it simply emits the @{b}callj@{ub}, leaving it for the linker to resolve.

Compare-and-Branch
..................

   The 960 architectures provide combined Compare-and-Branch
instructions that permit you to store the branch target in the lower 13
bits of the instruction word itself.  However, if you specify a branch
target far enough away that its address won't fit in 13 bits, the
assembler can either issue an error, or convert your Compare-and-Branch
instruction into separate instructions to do the compare and the branch.

   Whether @{b}as@{ub} gives an error or expands the instruction depends on two
choices you can make: whether you use the @{b}-no-relax@{ub} option, and whether
you use a "Compare and Branch" instruction or a "Compare and Jump"
instruction.  The "Jump" instructions are @{i}always@{ui} expanded if necessary;
the "Branch" instructions are expanded when necessary @{i}unless@{ui} you
specify @{b}-no-relax@{ub}--in which case @{b}as@{ub} gives an error instead.

   These are the Compare-and-Branch instructions, their "Jump" variants,
and the instruction pairs they may expand into:

          Branch      Jump       Expanded to

M680x0 Options
--------------

   The Motorola 680x0 version of @{b}as@{ub} has a few machine dependent options.

   You can use the @{b}-l@{ub} option to shorten the size of references to
undefined symbols.  If you do not use the @{b}-l@{ub} option, references to
undefined symbols are wide enough for a full @{b}long@{ub} (32 bits).  (Since @{b}as@{ub}
cannot know where these symbols end up, @{b}as@{ub} can only allocate space for
the linker to fill in later.  Since @{b}as@{ub} does not know how far away these
symbols are, it allocates as much space as it can.)  If you use this
option, the references are only one word wide (16 bits).  This may be
useful if you want the object file to be as small as possible, and you
know that the relevant symbols are always less than 17 bits away.

   For some configurations, especially those where the compiler normally
does not prepend an underscore to the names of user variables, the
assembler requires a @{b}%@{ub} before any use of a register name.  This is
intended to let the assembler distinguish between C variables and
functions named @{b}a0@{ub} through @{b}a7@{ub}, and so on.  The @{b}%@{ub} is always accepted,
but is not required for certain configurations, notably @{b}sun3@{ub}.  The
@{b}--register-prefix-optional@{ub} option may be used to permit omitting the @{b}%@{ub}
even for configurations for which it is normally required.  If this is
done, it will generally be impossible to refer to C variables and
functions with the same names as register names.

   Normally the character @{b}|@{ub} is treated as a comment character, which
means that it can not be used in expressions.  The @{b}--bitwise-or@{ub} option
turns @{b}|@{ub} into a normal character.  In this mode, you must either use C
style comments, or start comments with a @{b}#@{ub} character at the beginning
of a line.

   If you use an addressing mode with a base register without specifying
the size, @{b}as@{ub} will normally use the full 32 bit value.  For example, the
addressing mode @{b}%a0@(%d0)@{ub} is equivalent to @{b}%a0@(%d0:l)@{ub}.  You may use
the @{b}--base-size-default-16@{ub} option to tell @{b}as@{ub} to default to using the 16
bit value.  In this case, @{b}%a0@(%d0)@{ub} is equivalent to @{b}%a0@(%d0:w)@{ub}.  You
may use the @{b}--base-size-default-32@{ub} option to restore the default
behaviour.

   If you use an addressing mode with a displacement, and the value of
the displacement is not known, @{b}as@{ub} will normally assume that the value
is 32 bits.  For example, if the symbol @{b}disp@{ub} has not been defined, @{b}as@{ub}
will assemble the addressing mode @{b}%a0@(disp,%d0)@{ub} as though @{b}disp@{ub} is a 32
bit value.  You may use the @{b}--disp-size-default-16@{ub} option to tell @{b}as@{ub} to
instead assume that the displacement is 16 bits.  In this case, @{b}as@{ub} will
assemble @{b}%a0@(disp,%d0)@{ub} as though @{b}disp@{ub} is a 16 bit value.  You may use
the @{b}--disp-size-default-32@{ub} option to restore the default behaviour.

@{b}   as@{ub} can assemble code for several different members of the Motorola
680x0 family.  The default depends upon how @{b}as@{ub} was configured when it
was built; normally, the default is to assemble code for the 68020
microprocessor.  The following options may be used to change the
default.  These options control which instructions and addressing modes
are permitted.  The members of the 680x0 family are very similar.  For
detailed information about the differences, see the Motorola manuals.

@{b}-m68000@{ub}
@{b}-m68008@{ub}
@{b}-m68302@{ub}
     Assemble for the 68000.  @{b}-m68008@{ub} and @{b}-m68302@{ub} are synonyms for
     @{b}-m68000@{ub}, since the chips are the same from the point of view of
     the assembler.

@{b}-m68010@{ub}
     Assemble for the 68010.

@{b}-m68020@{ub}
     Assemble for the 68020.  This is normally the default.

@{b}-m68030@{ub}
     Assemble for the 68030.

@{b}-m68040@{ub}
     Assemble for the 68040.

@{b}-m68060@{ub}
     Assemble for the 68060.

@{b}-mcpu32@{ub}
@{b}-m68331@{ub}
@{b}-m68332@{ub}
@{b}-m68333@{ub}
@{b}-m68340@{ub}
@{b}-m68360@{ub}
     Assemble for the CPU32 family of chips.

@{b}-m5200@{ub}
     Assemble for the ColdFire family of chips.

@{b}-m68881@{ub}
@{b}-m68882@{ub}
     Assemble 68881 floating point instructions.  This is the default
     for the 68020, 68030, and the CPU32.  The 68040 and 68060 always
     support floating point instructions.

@{b}-mno-68881@{ub}
     Do not assemble 68881 floating point instructions.  This is the
     default for 68000 and the 68010.  The 68040 and 68060 always
     support floating point instructions, even if this option is used.

@{b}-m68851@{ub}
     Assemble 68851 MMU instructions.  This is the default for the
     68020, 68030, and 68060.  The 68040 accepts a somewhat different
     set of MMU instructions; @{b}-m68851@{ub} and @{b}-m68040@{ub} should not be used
     together.

@{b}-mno-68851@{ub}
     Do not assemble 68851 MMU instructions.  This is the default for
     the 68000, 68010, and the CPU32.  The 68040 accepts a somewhat
     different set of MMU instructions.

Syntax
------

   This syntax for the Motorola 680x0 was developed at MIT.

   The 680x0 version of @{b}as@{ub} uses instructions names and syntax
compatible with the Sun assembler.  Intervening periods are ignored;
for example, @{b}movl@{ub} is equivalent to @{b}mov.l@{ub}.

   In the following table APC stands for any of the address registers
(@{b}%a0@{ub} through @{b}%a7@{ub}), the program counter (@{b}%pc@{ub}), the zero-address relative
to the program counter (@{b}%zpc@{ub}), a suppressed address register (@{b}%za0@{ub}
through @{b}%za7@{ub}), or it may be omitted entirely.  The use of SIZE means
one of @{b}w@{ub} or @{b}l@{ub}, and it may be omitted, along with the leading colon,
unless a scale is also specified.  The use of SCALE means one of @{b}1@{ub}, @{b}2@{ub},
@{b}4@{ub}, or @{b}8@{ub}, and it may always be omitted along with the leading colon.

   The following addressing modes are understood:
@{i}Immediate@{ui}
@{b}     #NUMBER@{ub}

@{i}Data Register@{ui}
@{b}     %d0@{ub} through @{b}%d7@{ub}

Motorola Syntax
---------------

   The standard Motorola syntax for this chip differs from the syntax
already discussed (see @{"Syntax" link "M68K-Syntax"}).  @{b}as@{ub} can accept Motorola syntax for
operands, even if MIT syntax is used for other operands in the same
instruction.  The two kinds of syntax are fully compatible.

   In the following table APC stands for any of the address registers
(@{b}%a0@{ub} through @{b}%a7@{ub}), the program counter (@{b}%pc@{ub}), the zero-address relative
to the program counter (@{b}%zpc@{ub}), or a suppressed address register (@{b}%za0@{ub}
through @{b}%za7@{ub}).  The use of SIZE means one of @{b}w@{ub} or @{b}l@{ub}, and it may always
be omitted along with the leading dot.  The use of SCALE means one of
@{b}1@{ub}, @{b}2@{ub}, @{b}4@{ub}, or @{b}8@{ub}, and it may always be omitted along with the leading
asterisk.

   The following additional addressing modes are understood:

@{i}Address Register Indirect@{ui}
@{b}     (%a0)@{ub} through @{b}(%a7)@{ub}
@{b}     %a7@{ub} is also known as @{b}%sp@{ub}, i.e. the Stack Pointer.  @{b}%a6@{ub} is also
     known as @{b}%fp@{ub}, the Frame Pointer.

@{i}Address Register Postincrement@{ui}
@{b}     (%a0)+@{ub} through @{b}(%a7)+@{ub}

@{i}Address Register Predecrement@{ui}
@{b}     -(%a0)@{ub} through @{b}-(%a7)@{ub}

@{i}Indirect Plus Offset@{ui}
@{b}     NUMBER(%A0)@{ub} through @{b}NUMBER(%A7)@{ub}, or @{b}NUMBER(%PC)@{ub}.

     The NUMBER may also appear within the parentheses, as in
     @{b}(NUMBER,%A0)@{ub}.  When used with the PC, the NUMBER may be omitted
     (with an address register, omitting the NUMBER produces Address
     Register Indirect mode).

@{i}Index@{ui}
@{b}     NUMBER(APC,REGISTER.SIZE*SCALE)@{ub}

     The NUMBER may be omitted, or it may appear within the
     parentheses.  The APC may be omitted.  The REGISTER and the APC
     may appear in either order.  If both APC and REGISTER are address
     registers, and the SIZE and SCALE are omitted, then the first
     register is taken as the base register, and the second as the
     index register.

@{i}Postindex@{ui}
@{b}     ([NUMBER,APC],REGISTER.SIZE*SCALE,ONUMBER)@{ub}

     The ONUMBER, or the REGISTER, or both, may be omitted.  Either the
     NUMBER or the APC may be omitted, but not both.

@{i}Preindex@{ui}
@{b}     ([NUMBER,APC,REGISTER.SIZE*SCALE],ONUMBER)@{ub}

     The NUMBER, or the APC, or the REGISTER, or any two of them, may
     be omitted.  The ONUMBER may be omitted.  The REGISTER and the APC
     may appear in either order.  If both APC and REGISTER are address
     registers, and the SIZE and SCALE are omitted, then the first
     register is taken as the base register, and the second as the
     index register.

Branch Improvement
..................

   Certain pseudo opcodes are permitted for branch instructions.  They
expand to the shortest branch instruction that reach the target.
Generally these mnemonics are made by substituting @{b}j@{ub} for @{b}b@{ub} at the start
of a Motorola mnemonic.

   The following table summarizes the pseudo-operations.  A @{b}*@{ub} flags
cases that are more fully described after the table:

               Displacement
               +-------------------------------------------------
               |                68020   68000/10
     Pseudo-Op |BYTE    WORD    LONG    LONG      non-PC relative
               +-------------------------------------------------
          jbsr |bsrs    bsr     bsrl    jsr       jsr
           jra |bras    bra     bral    jmp       jmp
     *     jXX |bXXs    bXX     bXXl    bNXs;jmpl bNXs;jmp
     *    dbXX |dbXX    dbXX        dbXX; bra; jmpl
     *    fjXX |fbXXw   fbXXw   fbXXl             fbNXw;jmp
     
     XX: condition
     NX: negative of condition XX

                @{b}*@{ub}--see full description below

@{b}jbsr@{ub}
@{b}jra@{ub}
     These are the simplest jump pseudo-operations; they always map to
     one particular machine instruction, depending on the displacement
     to the branch target.

@{b}jXX@{ub}
     Here, @{b}jXX@{ub} stands for an entire family of pseudo-operations, where
     XX is a conditional branch or condition-code test.  The full list
     of pseudo-ops in this family is:
           jhi   jls   jcc   jcs   jne   jeq   jvc
           jvs   jpl   jmi   jge   jlt   jgt   jle

     For the cases of non-PC relative displacements and long
     displacements on the 68000 or 68010, @{b}as@{ub} issues a longer code
     fragment in terms of NX, the opposite condition to XX.  For
     example, for the non-PC relative case:
              jXX foo
     gives
               bNXs oof
               jmp foo
           oof:

@{b}dbXX@{ub}
     The full family of pseudo-operations covered here is
           dbhi   dbls   dbcc   dbcs   dbne   dbeq   dbvc
           dbvs   dbpl   dbmi   dbge   dblt   dbgt   dble
           dbf    dbra   dbt

     Other than for word and byte displacements, when the source reads
     @{b}dbXX foo@{ub}, @{b}as@{ub} emits
               dbXX oo1
               bra oo2
           oo1:jmpl foo
           oo2:

@{b}fjXX@{ub}
     This family includes
           fjne   fjeq   fjge   fjlt   fjgt   fjle   fjf
           fjt    fjgl   fjgle  fjnge  fjngl  fjngle fjngt

           fjor   fjseq  fjsf   fjsne  fjst   fjueq  fjuge
           fjugt  fjule  fjult  fjun

     For branch targets that are not PC relative, @{b}as@{ub} emits
               fbNX oof
               jmp foo
           oof:
     when it encounters @{b}fjXX foo@{ub}.

   GNU @{b}as@{ub} for MIPS architectures supports several different MIPS
processors, and MIPS ISA levels I through IV.  For information about
the MIPS instruction set, see `MIPS RISC Architecture', by Kane and
Heindrich (Prentice-Hall).  For an overview of MIPS assembly
conventions, see "Appendix D: Assembly Language Programming" in the

Assembler options
-----------------

   The MIPS configurations of GNU @{b}as@{ub} support these special options:

@{b}-G NUM@{ub}
     This option sets the largest size of an object that can be
     referenced implicitly with the @{b}gp@{ub} register.  It is only accepted
     for targets that use ECOFF format.  The default value is 8.

@{b}-EB@{ub}
@{b}-EL@{ub}
     Any MIPS configuration of @{b}as@{ub} can select big-endian or
     little-endian output at run time (unlike the other GNU development
     tools, which must be configured for one or the other).  Use @{b}-EB@{ub} to
     select big-endian output, and @{b}-EL@{ub} for little-endian.

@{b}-mips1@{ub}
@{b}-mips2@{ub}
@{b}-mips3@{ub}
@{b}-mips4@{ub}
     Generate code for a particular MIPS Instruction Set Architecture
     level.  @{b}-mips1@{ub} corresponds to the R2000 and R3000 processors,
     @{b}-mips2@{ub} to the R6000 processor, @{b}-mips3@{ub} to the R4000 processor, and
     @{b}-mips4@{ub} to the R8000 and R10000 processors.  You can also switch
     instruction sets during the assembly; see
     @{"Directives to override the ISA level" link "MIPS ISA"}.

@{b}-mips16@{ub}
@{b}-no-mips16@{ub}
     Generate code for the MIPS 16 processor.  This is equivalent to
     putting @{b}.set mips16@{ub} at the start of the assembly file.  @{b}-no-mips16@{ub}
     turns off this option.

@{b}-m4650@{ub}
@{b}-no-m4650@{ub}
     Generate code for the MIPS R4650 chip.  This tells the assembler
     to accept the @{b}mad@{ub} and @{b}madu@{ub} instruction, and to not schedule @{b}nop@{ub}
     instructions around accesses to the @{b}HI@{ub} and @{b}LO@{ub} registers.
     @{b}-no-m4650@{ub} turns off this option.

@{b}-m4010@{ub}
@{b}-no-m4010@{ub}
     Generate code for the LSI R4010 chip.  This tells the assembler to
     accept the R4010 specific instructions (@{b}addciu@{ub}, @{b}ffc@{ub}, etc.), and to
     not schedule @{b}nop@{ub} instructions around accesses to the @{b}HI@{ub} and @{b}LO@{ub}
     registers.  @{b}-no-m4010@{ub} turns off this option.

@{b}-mcpu=CPU@{ub}
     Generate code for a particular MIPS cpu.  This has little effect
     on the assembler, but it is passed by @{b}gcc@{ub}.

@{b}-nocpp@{ub}
     This option is ignored.  It is accepted for command-line
     compatibility with other assemblers, which use it to turn off C
     style preprocessing.  With GNU @{b}as@{ub}, there is no need for @{b}-nocpp@{ub},
     because the GNU assembler itself never runs the C preprocessor.

@{b}--trap@{ub}
@{b}--no-break@{ub}
@{b}     as@{ub} automatically macro expands certain division and multiplication
     instructions to check for overflow and division by zero.  This
     option causes @{b}as@{ub} to generate code to take a trap exception rather
     than a break exception when an error is detected.  The trap
     instructions are only supported at Instruction Set Architecture
     level 2 and higher.

@{b}--break@{ub}
@{b}--no-trap@{ub}
     Generate code to take a break exception rather than a trap
     exception when an error is detected.  This is the default.

MIPS ECOFF object code
----------------------

   Assembling for a MIPS ECOFF target supports some additional sections
besides the usual @{b}.text@{ub}, @{b}.data@{ub} and @{b}.bss@{ub}.  The additional sections are
@{b}.rdata@{ub}, used for read-only data, @{b}.sdata@{ub}, used for small data, and
@{b}.sbss@{ub}, used for small common objects.

   When assembling for ECOFF, the assembler uses the @{b}$gp@{ub} (@{b}$28@{ub}) register
to form the address of a "small object".  Any object in the @{b}.sdata@{ub} or
@{b}.sbss@{ub} sections is considered "small" in this sense.  For external
objects, or for objects in the @{b}.bss@{ub} section, you can use the @{b}gcc@{ub} @{b}-G@{ub}
option to control the size of objects addressed via @{b}$gp@{ub}; the default
value is 8, meaning that a reference to any object eight bytes or
smaller uses @{b}$gp@{ub}.  Passing @{b}-G 0@{ub} to @{b}as@{ub} prevents it from using the @{b}$gp@{ub}
register on the basis of object size (but the assembler uses @{b}$gp@{ub} for
objects in @{b}.sdata@{ub} or @{b}sbss@{ub} in any case).  The size of an object in the
@{b}.bss@{ub} section is set by the @{b}.comm@{ub} or @{b}.lcomm@{ub} directive that defines it.
The size of an external object may be set with the @{b}.extern@{ub} directive.
For example, @{b}.extern sym,4@{ub} declares that the object at @{b}sym@{ub} is 4 bytes
in length, whie leaving @{b}sym@{ub} otherwise undefined.

   Using small ECOFF objects requires linker support, and assumes that
the @{b}$gp@{ub} register is correctly initialized (normally done automatically
by the startup code).  MIPS ECOFF assembly code must not modify the @{b}$gp@{ub}
register.

Directives for debugging information
------------------------------------

   MIPS ECOFF @{b}as@{ub} supports several directives used for generating
debugging information which are not support by traditional MIPS
assemblers.  These are @{b}.def@{ub}, @{b}.endef@{ub}, @{b}.dim@{ub}, @{b}.file@{ub}, @{b}.scl@{ub}, @{b}.size@{ub}, @{b}.tag@{ub},
@{b}.type@{ub}, @{b}.val@{ub}, @{b}.stabd@{ub}, @{b}.stabn@{ub}, and @{b}.stabs@{ub}.  The debugging information
generated by the three @{b}.stab@{ub} directives can only be read by GDB, not by
traditional MIPS debuggers (this enhancement is required to fully
support C++ debugging).  These directives are primarily used by
compilers, not assembly language programmers!


@endnode

@node "MIPS ISA" "as.guide/MIPS ISA"
@next "MIPS insn"
@prev "MIPS Stabs"
@toc "MIPS-Dependent"

Directives to override the ISA level
------------------------------------

   GNU @{b}as@{ub} supports an additional directive to change the MIPS
Instruction Set Architecture level on the fly: @{b}.set mipsN@{ub}.  N should be
a number from 0 to 4.  A value from 1 to 4 makes the assembler accept
instructions for the corresponding ISA level, from that point on in the
assembly.  @{b}.set mipsN@{ub} affects not only which instructions are
permitted, but also how certain macros are expanded.  @{b}.set mips0@{ub}
restores the ISA level to its original level: either the level you
selected with command line options, or the default for your
configuration.  You can use this feature to permit specific R4000
instructions while assembling in 32 bit mode.  Use this directive with
care!

   The directive @{b}.set mips16@{ub} puts the assembler into MIPS 16 mode, in
which it will assemble instructions for the MIPS 16 processor.  Use
@{b}.set nomips16@{ub} to return to normal 32 bit mode.

   Traditional MIPS assemblers do not support this directive.


@endnode

@node "MIPS insn" "as.guide/MIPS insn"
@next "MIPS option stack"
@prev "MIPS ISA"
@toc "MIPS-Dependent"

Directive to mark data as an instruction
----------------------------------------

   The @{b}.insn@{ub} directive tells @{b}as@{ub} that the following data is actually
instructions.  This makes a difference in MIPS 16 mode: when loading
the address of a label which precedes instructions, @{b}as@{ub} automatically
adds 1 to the value, so that jumping to the loaded address will do the
right thing.


@endnode

@node "MIPS option stack" "as.guide/MIPS option stack"
@prev "MIPS insn"
@toc "MIPS-Dependent"

Directives to save and restore options
--------------------------------------

   The directives @{b}.set push@{ub} and @{b}.set pop@{ub} may be used to save and
restore the current settings for all the options which are controlled
by @{b}.set@{ub}.  The @{b}.set push@{ub} directive saves the current settings on a
stack.  The @{b}.set pop@{ub} directive pops the stack and restores the settings.

   These directives can be useful inside an macro which must change an
option such as the ISA level or instruction reordering but does not want
to change the state of the code which invoked the macro.

   Traditional MIPS assemblers do not support these directives.

Opcodes
-------

   For detailed information on the SH machine instruction set, see
`SH-Microcomputer User's Manual' (Hitachi Micro Systems, Inc.).

@{b}   as@{ub} implements all the standard SH opcodes.  No additional
pseudo-instructions are needed on this family.  Note, however, that
because @{b}as@{ub} supports a simpler form of PC-relative addressing, you may
simply write (for example)

     mov.l  bar,r0

where other assemblers might require an explicit displacement to @{b}bar@{ub}
from the program counter:

     mov.l  \@(DISP, PC)

   Here is a summary of SH opcodes:

Options
-------

   The SPARC chip family includes several successive levels, using the
same core instruction set, but including a few additional instructions
at each level.  There are exceptions to this however.  For details on
what instructions each variant supports, please see the chip's
architecture reference manual.

   By default, @{b}as@{ub} assumes the core instruction set (SPARC v6), but
"bumps" the architecture level as needed: it switches to successively
higher architectures as it encounters instructions that only exist in
the higher levels.

   If not configured for SPARC v9 (@{b}sparc64-*-*@{ub}) GAS will not bump
passed sparclite by default, an option must be passed to enable the v9
instructions.

   GAS treats sparclite as being compatible with v8, unless an
architecture is explicitly requested.  SPARC v9 is always incompatible
with sparclite.

@{b}-Av6 | -Av7 | -Av8 | -Asparclet | -Asparclite | -Av9 | -Av9a@{ub}
     Use one of the @{b}-A@{ub} options to select one of the SPARC architectures
     explicitly.  If you select an architecture explicitly, @{b}as@{ub} reports
     a fatal error if it encounters an instruction or feature requiring
     a higher level.

@{b}-xarch=v8plus | -xarch=v8plusa@{ub}
     For compatibility with the Solaris v9 assembler.  These options are
     equivalent to -Av9 and -Av9a, respectively.

@{b}-bump@{ub}
     Warn whenever it is necessary to switch to another level.  If an
     architecture level is explicitly requested, GAS will not issue
     warnings until that level is reached, and will then bump the level
     as required (except between incompatible levels).

Enforcing aligned data
----------------------

   SPARC GAS normally permits data to be misaligned.  For example, it
permits the @{b}.long@{ub} pseudo-op to be used on a byte boundary.  However,
the native SunOS and Solaris assemblers issue an error when they see
misaligned data.

   You can use the @{b}--enforce-aligned-data@{ub} option to make SPARC GAS also
issue an error about misaligned data, just as the SunOS and Solaris
assemblers do.

   The @{b}--enforce-aligned-data@{ub} option is not the default because gcc
issues misaligned data pseudo-ops when it initializes certain packed
data structures (structures defined using the @{b}packed@{ub} attribute).  You
may have to assemble with GAS in order to initialize packed data
structures in your own code.

Sparc Machine Directives
------------------------

   The Sparc version of @{b}as@{ub} supports the following additional machine
directives:

@{b}.align@{ub}
     This must be followed by the desired alignment in bytes.

@{b}.common@{ub}
     This must be followed by a symbol name, a positive number, and
     @{b}"bss"@{ub}.  This behaves somewhat like @{b}.comm@{ub}, but the syntax is
     different.

@{b}.half@{ub}
     This is functionally identical to @{b}.short@{ub}.

@{b}.proc@{ub}
     This directive is ignored.  Any text following it on the same line
     is also ignored.

@{b}.reserve@{ub}
     This must be followed by a symbol name, a positive number, and
     @{b}"bss"@{ub}.  This behaves somewhat like @{b}.lcomm@{ub}, but the syntax is
     different.

@{b}.seg@{ub}
     This must be followed by @{b}"text"@{ub}, @{b}"data"@{ub}, or @{b}"data1"@{ub}.  It behaves
     like @{b}.text@{ub}, @{b}.data@{ub}, or @{b}.data 1@{ub}.

@{b}.skip@{ub}
     This is functionally identical to the @{b}.space@{ub} directive.

@{b}.word@{ub}
     On the Sparc, the @{b}.word@{ub} directive produces 32 bit values, instead
     of the 16 bit values it produces on many other machines.

@{b}.xword@{ub}
     On the Sparc V9 processor, the @{b}.xword@{ub} directive produces 64 bit
     values.

Z8000 Dependent Features
========================

   The Z8000 as supports both members of the Z8000 family: the
unsegmented Z8002, with 16 bit addresses, and the segmented Z8001 with
24 bit addresses.

   When the assembler is in unsegmented mode (specified with the @{b}unsegm@{ub}
directive), an address takes up one word (16 bit) sized register.  When
the assembler is in segmented mode (specified with the @{b}segm@{ub} directive),
a 24-bit address takes up a long (32 bit) register.  See
@{"Assembler Directives for the Z8000" link "Z8000 Directives"}, for a list of other Z8000
specific assembler directives.

@{b}rN@{ub}
     Register direct

@{b}@rN@{ub}
     Indirect register

@{b}ADDR@{ub}
     Direct: the 16 bit or 24 bit address (depending on whether the
     assembler is in segmented or unsegmented mode) of the operand is
     in the instruction.

@{b}address(rN)@{ub}
     Indexed: the 16 or 24 bit address is added to the 16 bit register
     to produce the final address in memory of the operand.

@{b}rN(#IMM)@{ub}
     Base Address: the 16 or 24 bit register is added to the 16 bit sign
     extended immediate displacement to produce the final address in
     memory of the operand.

@{b}rN(rM)@{ub}
     Base Index: the 16 or 24 bit register rN is added to the sign
     extended 16 bit index register rM to produce the final address in
     memory of the operand.

@{b}#XX@{ub}
     Immediate data XX.

Assembler Directives for the Z8000
----------------------------------

   The Z8000 port of as includes these additional assembler directives,
for compatibility with other Z8000 assemblers.  As shown, these do not
begin with @{b}.@{ub} (unlike the ordinary as directives).

@{b}segm@{ub}
     Generates code for the segmented Z8001.

@{b}unsegm@{ub}
     Generates code for the unsegmented Z8002.

@{b}name@{ub}
     Synonym for @{b}.file@{ub}

@{b}global@{ub}
     Synonym for @{b}.global@{ub}

@{b}wval@{ub}
     Synonym for @{b}.word@{ub}

@{b}lval@{ub}
     Synonym for @{b}.long@{ub}

@{b}bval@{ub}
     Synonym for @{b}.byte@{ub}

@{b}sval@{ub}
     Assemble a string.  @{b}sval@{ub} expects one string literal, delimited by
     single quotes.  It assembles each byte of the string into
     consecutive addresses.  You can use the escape sequence @{b}%XX@{ub} (where
     XX represents a two-digit hexadecimal number) to represent the
     character whose ASCII value is XX.  Use this feature to describe
     single quote and other characters that may not appear in string
     literals as themselves.  For example, the C statement
     @{b}char *a = "he said \\"it's 50% off\\"";@{ub} is represented in Z8000
     assembly language (shown with the assembler output in hex at the
     left) as

          68652073    sval    'he said %22it%27s 50%25 off%22%00'

@{b}rsect@{ub}
     synonym for @{b}.section@{ub}

@{b}block@{ub}
     synonym for @{b}.space@{ub}

@{b}even@{ub}
     special case of @{b}.align@{ub}; aligns output to even byte boundary.

VAX Command-Line Options
------------------------

   The Vax version of @{b}as@{ub} accepts any of the following options, gives a
warning message that the option was ignored and proceeds.  These
options are for compatibility with scripts designed for other people's
assemblers.

@{b}@{b}-D@{ub} (Debug)@{ub}
@{b}@{b}-S@{ub} (Symbol Table)@{ub}
@{b}@{b}-T@{ub} (Token Trace)@{ub}
     These are obsolete options used to debug old assemblers.

@{b}@{b}-d@{ub} (Displacement size for JUMPs)@{ub}
     This option expects a number following the @{b}-d@{ub}.  Like options that
     expect filenames, the number may immediately follow the @{b}-d@{ub} (old
     standard) or constitute the whole of the command line argument
     that follows @{b}-d@{ub} (GNU standard).

@{b}@{b}-V@{ub} (Virtualize Interpass Temporary File)@{ub}
     Some other assemblers use a temporary file.  This option commanded
     them to keep the information in active memory rather than in a
     disk file.  @{b}as@{ub} always does this, so this option is redundant.

@{b}@{b}-J@{ub} (JUMPify Longer Branches)@{ub}
     Many 32-bit computers permit a variety of branch instructions to
     do the same job.  Some of these instructions are short (and fast)
     but have a limited range; others are long (and slow) but can
     branch anywhere in virtual memory.  Often there are 3 flavors of
     branch: short, medium and long.  Some other assemblers would emit
     short and medium branches, unless told by this option to emit
     short and long branches.

@{b}@{b}-t@{ub} (Temporary File Directory)@{ub}
     Some other assemblers may use a temporary file, and this option
     takes a filename being the directory to site the temporary file.
     Since @{b}as@{ub} does not use a temporary disk file, this option makes no
     difference.  @{b}-t@{ub} needs exactly one filename.

   The Vax version of the assembler accepts two options when compiled
for VMS.  They are @{b}-h@{ub}, and @{b}-+@{ub}.  The @{b}-h@{ub} option prevents @{b}as@{ub} from
modifying the symbol-table entries for symbols that contain lowercase
characters (I think).  The @{b}-+@{ub} option causes @{b}as@{ub} to print warning
messages if the FILENAME part of the object file, or any symbol name is
larger than 31 characters.  The @{b}-+@{ub} option also inserts some code
following the @{b}_main@{ub} symbol so that the object file is compatible with
Vax-11 "C".

VAX Floating Point
------------------

   Conversion of flonums to floating point is correct, and compatible
with previous assemblers.  Rounding is towards zero if the remainder is
exactly half the least significant bit.

@{b}   D@{ub}, @{b}F@{ub}, @{b}G@{ub} and @{b}H@{ub} floating point formats are understood.

   Immediate floating literals (@{i}e.g.@{ui} @{b}S`$6.9@{ub}) are rendered correctly.
Again, rounding is towards zero in the boundary case.

   The @{b}.float@{ub} directive produces @{b}f@{ub} format numbers.  The @{b}.double@{ub}
directive produces @{b}d@{ub} format numbers.

Vax Machine Directives
----------------------

   The Vax version of the assembler supports four directives for
generating Vax floating point constants.  They are described in the
table below.

@{b}.dfloat@{ub}
     This expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas, and
     assembles Vax @{b}d@{ub} format 64-bit floating point constants.

@{b}.ffloat@{ub}
     This expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas, and
     assembles Vax @{b}f@{ub} format 32-bit floating point constants.

@{b}.gfloat@{ub}
     This expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas, and
     assembles Vax @{b}g@{ub} format 64-bit floating point constants.

@{b}.hfloat@{ub}
     This expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas, and
     assembles Vax @{b}h@{ub} format 128-bit floating point constants.

VAX Opcodes
-----------

   All DEC mnemonics are supported.  Beware that @{b}case...@{ub} instructions
have exactly 3 operands.  The dispatch table that follows the @{b}case...@{ub}
instruction should be made with @{b}.word@{ub} statements.  This is compatible
with all unix assemblers we know of.

VAX Branch Improvement
----------------------

   Certain pseudo opcodes are permitted.  They are for branch
instructions.  They expand to the shortest branch instruction that
reaches the target.  Generally these mnemonics are made by substituting
@{b}j@{ub} for @{b}b@{ub} at the start of a DEC mnemonic.  This feature is included both
for compatibility and to help compilers.  If you do not need this
feature, avoid these opcodes.  Here are the mnemonics, and the code
they can expand into.

@{b}jbsb@{ub}
@{b}     Jsb@{ub} is already an instruction mnemonic, so we chose @{b}jbsb@{ub}.

@{b}jCOND@{ub}
     COND may be any one of the conditional branches @{b}neq@{ub}, @{b}nequ@{ub}, @{b}eql@{ub},
     @{b}eqlu@{ub}, @{b}gtr@{ub}, @{b}geq@{ub}, @{b}lss@{ub}, @{b}gtru@{ub}, @{b}lequ@{ub}, @{b}vc@{ub}, @{b}vs@{ub}, @{b}gequ@{ub}, @{b}cc@{ub}, @{b}lssu@{ub}, @{b}cs@{ub}.  COND
     may also be one of the bit tests @{b}bs@{ub}, @{b}bc@{ub}, @{b}bss@{ub}, @{b}bcs@{ub}, @{b}bsc@{ub}, @{b}bcc@{ub}, @{b}bssi@{ub},
     @{b}bcci@{ub}, @{b}lbs@{ub}, @{b}lbc@{ub}.  NOTCOND is the opposite condition to COND.

VAX Operands
------------

   The immediate character is @{b}$@{ub} for Unix compatibility, not @{b}#@{ub} as DEC
writes it.

   The indirect character is @{b}*@{ub} for Unix compatibility, not @{b}@@{ub} as DEC
writes it.

   The displacement sizing character is @{b}`@{ub} (an accent grave) for Unix
compatibility, not @{b}^@{ub} as DEC writes it.  The letter preceding @{b}`@{ub} may have
either case.  @{b}G@{ub} is not understood, but all other letters (@{b}b i l s w@{ub})
are understood.

   Register names understood are @{b}r0 r1 r2 ... r15 ap fp sp pc@{ub}.  Upper
and lower case letters are equivalent.

   For instance
     tstb *w`$4(r5)

   Any expression is permitted in an operand.  Operands are comma
separated.

Reporting Bugs
**************

   Your bug reports play an essential role in making @{b}as@{ub} reliable.

   Reporting a bug may help you by bringing a solution to your problem,
or it may not.  But in any case the principal function of a bug report
is to help the entire community by making the next version of @{b}as@{ub} work
better.  Bug reports are your contribution to the maintenance of @{b}as@{ub}.

   In order for a bug report to serve its purpose, you must include the
information that enables us to fix the bug.

Have you found a bug?
=====================

   If you are not sure whether you have found a bug, here are some
guidelines:

   * If the assembler gets a fatal signal, for any input whatever, that
     is a @{b}as@{ub} bug.  Reliable assemblers never crash.

   * If @{b}as@{ub} produces an error message for valid input, that is a bug.

   * If @{b}as@{ub} does not produce an error message for invalid input, that is
     a bug.  However, you should note that your idea of "invalid input"
     might be our idea of "an extension" or "support for traditional
     practice".

   * If you are an experienced user of assemblers, your suggestions for
     improvement of @{b}as@{ub} are welcome in any case.

How to report bugs
==================

   A number of companies and individuals offer support for GNU
products.  If you obtained @{b}as@{ub} from a support organization, we recommend
you contact that organization first.

   You can find contact information for many support companies and
individuals in the file @{b}etc/SERVICE@{ub} in the GNU Emacs distribution.

   In any event, we also recommend that you send bug reports for @{b}as@{ub} to
@{b}bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu@{ub}.

   The fundamental principle of reporting bugs usefully is this: @{b}report
all the facts@{ub}.  If you are not sure whether to state a fact or leave it
out, state it!

   Often people omit facts because they think they know what causes the
problem and assume that some details do not matter.  Thus, you might
assume that the name of a symbol you use in an example does not matter.
Well, probably it does not, but one cannot be sure.  Perhaps the bug
is a stray memory reference which happens to fetch from the location
where that name is stored in memory; perhaps, if the name were
different, the contents of that location would fool the assembler into
doing the right thing despite the bug.  Play it safe and give a
specific, complete example.  That is the easiest thing for you to do,
and the most helpful.

   Keep in mind that the purpose of a bug report is to enable us to fix
the bug if it is new to us.  Therefore, always write your bug reports
on the assumption that the bug has not been reported previously.

   Sometimes people give a few sketchy facts and ask, "Does this ring a
bell?"  Those bug reports are useless, and we urge everyone to @{i}refuse
to respond to them@{ui} except to chide the sender to report bugs properly.

   To enable us to fix the bug, you should include all these things:

   * The version of @{b}as@{ub}.  @{b}as@{ub} announces it if you start it with the
     @{b}--version@{ub} argument.

     Without this, we will not know whether there is any point in
     looking for the bug in the current version of @{b}as@{ub}.

   * Any patches you may have applied to the @{b}as@{ub} source.

   * The type of machine you are using, and the operating system name
     and version number.

   * What compiler (and its version) was used to compile @{b}as@{ub}--e.g.
     "@{b}gcc-2.7@{ub}".

   * The command arguments you gave the assembler to assemble your
     example and observe the bug.  To guarantee you will not omit
     something important, list them all.  A copy of the Makefile (or
     the output from make) is sufficient.

     If we were to try to guess the arguments, we would probably guess
     wrong and then we might not encounter the bug.

   * A complete input file that will reproduce the bug.  If the bug is
     observed when the assembler is invoked via a compiler, send the
     assembler source, not the high level language source.  Most
     compilers will produce the assembler source when run with the @{b}-S@{ub}
     option.  If you are using @{b}gcc@{ub}, use the options @{b}-v --save-temps@{ub};
     this will save the assembler source in a file with an extension of
     @{b}.s@{ub}, and also show you exactly how @{b}as@{ub} is being run.

   * A description of what behavior you observe that you believe is
     incorrect.  For example, "It gets a fatal signal."

     Of course, if the bug is that @{b}as@{ub} gets a fatal signal, then we will
     certainly notice it.  But if the bug is incorrect output, we might
     not notice unless it is glaringly wrong.  You might as well not
     give us a chance to make a mistake.

     Even if the problem you experience is a fatal signal, you should
     still say so explicitly.  Suppose something strange is going on,
     such as, your copy of @{b}as@{ub} is out of synch, or you have encountered
     a bug in the C library on your system.  (This has happened!)  Your
     copy might crash and ours would not.  If you told us to expect a
     crash, then when ours fails to crash, we would know that the bug
     was not happening for us.  If you had not told us to expect a
     crash, then we would not be able to draw any conclusion from our
     observations.

   * If you wish to suggest changes to the @{b}as@{ub} source, send us context
     diffs, as generated by @{b}diff@{ub} with the @{b}-u@{ub}, @{b}-c@{ub}, or @{b}-p@{ub} option.  Always
     send diffs from the old file to the new file.  If you even discuss
     something in the @{b}as@{ub} source, refer to it by context, not by line
     number.

     The line numbers in our development sources will not match those
     in your sources.  Your line numbers would convey no useful
     information to us.

   Here are some things that are not necessary:

   * A description of the envelope of the bug.

     Often people who encounter a bug spend a lot of time investigating
     which changes to the input file will make the bug go away and which
     changes will not affect it.

     This is often time consuming and not very useful, because the way
     we will find the bug is by running a single example under the
     debugger with breakpoints, not by pure deduction from a series of
     examples.  We recommend that you save your time for something else.

     Of course, if you can find a simpler example to report @{i}instead@{ui} of
     the original one, that is a convenience for us.  Errors in the
     output will be easier to spot, running under the debugger will take
     less time, and so on.

     However, simplification is not vital; if you do not want to do
     this, report the bug anyway and send us the entire test case you
     used.

   * A patch for the bug.

     A patch for the bug does help us if it is a good one.  But do not
     omit the necessary information, such as the test case, on the
     assumption that a patch is all we need.  We might see problems
     with your patch and decide to fix the problem another way, or we
     might not understand it at all.

     Sometimes with a program as complicated as @{b}as@{ub} it is very hard to
     construct an example that will make the program follow a certain
     path through the code.  If you do not send us the example, we will
     not be able to construct one, so we will not be able to verify
     that the bug is fixed.

     And if we cannot understand what bug you are trying to fix, or why
     your patch should be an improvement, we will not install it.  A
     test case will help us to understand.

   * A guess about what the bug is or what it depends on.

     Such guesses are usually wrong.  Even we cannot guess right about
     such things without first using the debugger to find the facts.

Acknowledgements
****************

   If you have contributed to @{b}as@{ub} and your name isn't listed here, it is
not meant as a slight.  We just don't know about it.  Send mail to the
maintainer, and we'll correct the situation.  Currently the maintainer
is Ken Raeburn (email address @{b}raeburn@cygnus.com@{ub}).

   Dean Elsner wrote the original GNU assembler for the VAX.(1)

   Jay Fenlason maintained GAS for a while, adding support for
GDB-specific debug information and the 68k series machines, most of the
preprocessing pass, and extensive changes in @{b}messages.c@{ub}, @{b}input-file.c@{ub},
@{b}write.c@{ub}.

   K. Richard Pixley maintained GAS for a while, adding various
enhancements and many bug fixes, including merging support for several
processors, breaking GAS up to handle multiple object file format back
ends (including heavy rewrite, testing, an integration of the coff and
b.out back ends), adding configuration including heavy testing and
verification of cross assemblers and file splits and renaming,
converted GAS to strictly ANSI C including full prototypes, added
support for m680[34]0 and cpu32, did considerable work on i960
including a COFF port (including considerable amounts of reverse
engineering), a SPARC opcode file rewrite, DECstation, rs6000, and
hp300hpux host ports, updated "know" assertions and made them work,
much other reorganization, cleanup, and lint.

   Ken Raeburn wrote the high-level BFD interface code to replace most
of the code in format-specific I/O modules.

   The original VMS support was contributed by David L. Kashtan.  Eric
Youngdale has done much work with it since.

   The Intel 80386 machine description was written by Eliot Dresselhaus.

   Minh Tran-Le at IntelliCorp contributed some AIX 386 support.

   The Motorola 88k machine description was contributed by Devon Bowen
of Buffalo University and Torbjorn Granlund of the Swedish Institute of
Computer Science.

   Keith Knowles at the Open Software Foundation wrote the original
MIPS back end (@{b}tc-mips.c@{ub}, @{b}tc-mips.h@{ub}), and contributed Rose format
support (which hasn't been merged in yet).  Ralph Campbell worked with
the MIPS code to support a.out format.

   Support for the Zilog Z8k and Hitachi H8/300 and H8/500 processors
(tc-z8k, tc-h8300, tc-h8500), and IEEE 695 object file format
(obj-ieee), was written by Steve Chamberlain of Cygnus Support.  Steve
also modified the COFF back end to use BFD for some low-level
operations, for use with the H8/300 and AMD 29k targets.

   John Gilmore built the AMD 29000 support, added @{b}.include@{ub} support, and
simplified the configuration of which versions accept which directives.
He updated the 68k machine description so that Motorola's opcodes
always produced fixed-size instructions (e.g. @{b}jsr@{ub}), while synthetic
instructions remained shrinkable (@{b}jbsr@{ub}).  John fixed many bugs,
including true tested cross-compilation support, and one bug in
relaxation that took a week and required the proverbial one-bit fix.

   Ian Lance Taylor of Cygnus Support merged the Motorola and MIT
syntax for the 68k, completed support for some COFF targets (68k, i386
SVR3, and SCO Unix), added support for MIPS ECOFF and ELF targets,
wrote the initial RS/6000 and PowerPC assembler, and made a few other
minor patches.

   Steve Chamberlain made @{b}as@{ub} able to generate listings.

   Hewlett-Packard contributed support for the HP9000/300.

   Jeff Law wrote GAS and BFD support for the native HPPA object format
(SOM) along with a fairly extensive HPPA testsuite (for both SOM and
ELF object formats).  This work was supported by both the Center for
Software Science at the University of Utah and Cygnus Support.

   Support for ELF format files has been worked on by Mark Eichin of
Cygnus Support (original, incomplete implementation for SPARC), Pete
Hoogenboom and Jeff Law at the University of Utah (HPPA mainly),
Michael Meissner of the Open Software Foundation (i386 mainly), and Ken
Raeburn of Cygnus Support (sparc, and some initial 64-bit support).

   Richard Henderson rewrote the Alpha assembler. Klaus Kaempf wrote
GAS and BFD support for openVMS/Alpha.

   Several engineers at Cygnus Support have also provided many small
bug fixes and configuration enhancements.

   Many others have contributed large or small bugfixes and
enhancements.  If you have contributed significant work and are not
mentioned on this list, and want to be, let us know.  Some of the
history has been lost; we are not intentionally leaving anyone out.
